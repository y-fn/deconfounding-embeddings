# The Repository for the EMNLP 2025 Paper ***The Medium is Not the Message: Deconfounding Document Embeddings via Linear Concept Erasure***

The current [pipeline](https://github.com/y-fn/deconfounding-text-embeddings/blob/main/style_erasure_pipeline.py) generates and saves plots for the following visualizations:
- K-means clusterings, both before and after LEACE erasure;
- PCA projections, before and after LEACE erasure;
- Top-k retrieval results, before and after erasure;
- Total # of exact pairs, before and after erasure.

In addition, we provide all [data](https://github.com/y-fn/deconfounding-text-embeddings/tree/main/data) used in our paper.
