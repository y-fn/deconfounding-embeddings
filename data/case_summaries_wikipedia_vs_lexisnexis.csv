Taco Cabana, Inc., 505 U.S. 763 (1992), was a United States Supreme Court case where the Court held that Two Pesos, Inc. infringed upon the trademark of Taco Cabana, Inc. by copying the design of their restaurants. Writing for a majority of the court, Justice Byron White concluded that trade dress is inherently distinctive under the Lanham Act and that plaintiffs are not required to prove secondary meaning in suits to protect their trademark. The Court upheld an award of $3.7 million in damages, and Taco Cabana ultimately acquired all of Two Pesos' assets in 1993 for $22 million.",wiki

"Trammel v. United States, 445 U.S. 40 (1980), is a United States Supreme Court case involving the spousal privilege and its application in the law of evidence. In it, the Court held that the witness-spouse alone has a privilege to refuse to testify adversely; the witness may be neither compelled to testify nor foreclosed from testifying.
In it, the court upheld the conviction of the Petitioner. Prior to presenting his case before the Supreme Court, the Petitioner was convicted of illegally smuggling heroin into the United States and conspiracy to import, based upon the testimony of his wife. The Petitioner then appealed, claiming that the admission of the adverse testimony of his wife, over his objection, contravened prior precedent and therefore constituted reversible error.
The court rejected both traditional and contemporary justifications for the traditional scope of the privilege.
In so ruling, the court held that a witness-spouse alone has a privilege to refuse to testify adversely; the witness may be neither compelled to testify nor foreclosed from testifying.",wiki

"Polar Tankers, Inc. v. City of Valdez, 557 U.S. 1 (2009), was a decision by the Supreme Court of the United States involving the tonnage clause of the United States Constitution.
The City of Valdez in Alaska imposed a property tax that, in practice, applied only to large oil tankers. Polar Tankers, a ConocoPhillips subsidiary, sued, arguing that the tax violated the Tonnage Clause of the Constitution, which forbids a state, ""without the Consent of Congress, [to] lay any Duty of Tonnage.""
The Supreme Court agreed with Polar Tankers. The court noted that the original meaning of the clause was as a term of art for a tax imposed that varies with ""the internal cubic capacity of a vessel,"" but emphasized that a consistent line of cases had read the clause broadly, ""forbidding a State to do that indirectly which she is forbidden ... to do directly."" Those cases, the court concluded, stood for the proposition that the tonnage clause's prohibition reaches any taxes or duties on a ship, ""whether a fixed sum upon its whole tonnage, or a sum to be ascertained by comparing the amount of tonnage with the rate of duty[,] ... regardless of [the tax or duty's] name or form ... which operate to impose a charge for the privilege of entering, trading in, or lying in a port.""
With this premise in mind, the court concluded that because Valdez taxes ""ships and to no other property at all[,] ... in order to obtain revenue for general city purposes[, this was] ... the kind of tax that the Tonnage Clause forbids Valdez to impose without the consent of Congress, consent that Valdez lacks.""",wiki
"Williamson v. Mazda Motor of America, Inc., 562 U.S. 323 (2011), was a decision by the Supreme Court of the United States, in which the Court unanimously held that Federal Motor Vehicle Safety Standard 208, promulgated by the National Highway Traffic Safety Administration, does not federally preempt state tort lawsuits against auto manufacturers from injuries caused by a defective lack of certain types of seat belts.
The case arose when Thanh Williamson died in a 2002 auto accident from seat-belt related injuries. Williamson's family filed suit against Mazda Motor of America in California state court, claiming a defective design leading to a wrongful death. However, the California trial court dismissed the suit on the pleadings, agreeing with Mazda that the action was preempted by federal law, and the California Court of Appeal affirmed the dismissal. The California Supreme Court declined to review the case, but the U.S. Supreme Court accepted the Williamson's petition for certiorari.
In a unanimous decision handed down on February 23, 2011, the Court unanimously (8-0, with Justice Elena Kagan not taking part in this case) reversed the California courts and held that federal preemption does not apply. Justice Stephen Breyer wrote the decision of the court. Justice Sonia Sotomayor wrote a concurring opinion, and Justice Clarence Thomas wrote an opinion concurring in the judgment.",wiki
"United States ex rel. Accardi v. Shaughnessy, 347 U.S. 260 (1954), is a landmark United States Supreme Court case, in administrative law, in which the Court held that administrative agencies in the Federal Government are obliged to follow their own regulations, policies and procedures. Under the Accardi doctrine, named after this case, federal agencies which do not follow their own regulations or procedures run the risk of having their actions invalidated if challenged in court.
The Accardi doctrine was later strengthened in Service v. Dulles 354 US 363 (1957)  and Vitarelli v. Seaton, 359 US 535 (1959) 
Due to a ruling in United States v. Fausto, the doctrine generally does not apply to Federal employment decisions that are covered by the Civil Service Reform Act of 1978.",wiki

Brennan writing for a unanimous United States Supreme Court articulated a four factor test for federal courts to apply when deciding whether the implication doctrine allows a cause of action to be inferred from a federal statute that does not clearly state a civil remedy.
The Cort criteria were applied by some lower federal courts as a restrictive standard to test applications of the implication doctrine, including a 7th Circuit decision, later reversed by the Supreme Court, which held no private right of action exists under Title IX to challenge a denial of admission to medical school as gender-based discrimination.",wiki

Garner, 471 U.S. 1 (1985), is a civil case in which the Supreme Court of the United States held that, under the Fourth Amendment, when a law enforcement officer is pursuing a fleeing suspect, the officer may not use deadly force to prevent escape unless ""the officer has probable cause to believe that the suspect poses a significant threat of death or serious physical injury to the officer or others.""
It was found that the use of deadly force to prevent escape is an unreasonable seizure under the Fourth Amendment, in the absence of probable cause that the fleeing suspect posed a physical danger.: 563–7  Legal scholars have expressed support for this decision stating that the decision had ""a strong effect on police behavior"" and specifically that it can ""influence police use of deadly force.""

Collins, 342 U.S. 519 (1952), is a decision by the United States Supreme Court, holding that kidnapping of a defendant by State authorities for the purpose of taking a suspect from one jurisdiction to another for criminal trial, is constitutional. The defendant was tried in Michigan after being abducted by Michigan authorities in Chicago, Illinois. The case relied upon Ker v. Illinois (1886).

"Bellotti v. Baird, 428 U.S. 132 (1976), was a United States Supreme Court case in which the Court upheld a Massachusetts law requiring parental consent to a minor's abortion, under the provision that ""if one or both of the [minor]'s parents refuse... consent, consent may be obtained by order of a judge... for good cause shown."" The decision was unanimous, and the opinion of the Court was written by Harry Blackmun. The law in question ""permits a minor capable of giving informed consent to obtain a court order allowing abortion without parental consultation, and further permits even a minor incapable of giving informed consent to obtain an abortion order without parental consultation where it is shown that abortion would be in her best interests.""
The case was initially titled  as Baird v. Quinn (Baird et al. v. Quinn et al.) since that proceedings commenced, Robert H. Quinn was the attorney general of Massachusetts. He was replaced in 1975 by Francis X. Bellotti.",wiki
"North v. Russell, 427 U.S. 328 (1976), is a United States Supreme Court case which held that a non-lawyer jurist can constitutionally sit in a jail-carrying criminal case provided that the defendant has an opportunity through an appeal to obtain a second trial before a judge who is a lawyer.

"Jones v. Harris Associates L.P., 559 U.S. 335 (2010), is a case decided by the United States Supreme Court in which investors claimed that the fees they paid to an investment advisor were too steep, violating the Investment Company Act of 1940.
The case held that the court has the jurisdiction to regulate fees of investment advisers in the mutual fund industry under the Investment Company Act of 1940, when those fees are excessive, and in breach of fiduciary duty. It is notable from a law and economics perspective for the vigorous opinion in the Seventh Circuit Court of Appeal of Judge Frank Easterbrook and the powerful dissent of Richard Posner, regarding the necessity and market failure in respect of adviser fee regulation.

"United States v. R. Enterprises, Inc., 498 U.S. 292 (1991), was a United States Supreme Court case in which the court held that the three prong test for the issuance of a subpoena in United States v. Nixon does not apply to subpoenas issued by a grand jury. The Court concluded by stating that when a grand jury subpoena is challenged on relevancy grounds, the motion to quash must be denied ""unless the district court determines that there is no reasonable possibility that the materials sought will produce information relevant to the grand jury's investigation.""",wiki
"Durham v. United States, 401 U.S. 481 (1971), was a United States Supreme Court case in which the Court held that the death of a defendant pending a petition for certiorari before the Supreme Court on direct review of the criminal conviction will cause the Court to vacate the conviction. In a per curiam opinion, the Court wrote that ""[t]he unanimity of the lower federal courts"" in vacating criminal convictions when the defendant dies during direct review was ""impressive"" and accordingly vacated the original conviction.
In a one-sentence dissent, Justice Marshall, joined by Chief Justice Burger and Justice Stewart, wrote that the Court should dismiss only the petition for writ of certiorari rather than the entire conviction, writing:

MR. JUSTICE MARSHALL, whom THE CHIEF JUSTICE and MR. JUSTICE STEWART join, believes that the case should be disposed of as follows:  The petitioner having died while his petition for certiorari was pending before this Court, we dismiss the petition as moot and direct the Court of Appeals to note this action on its records.
Justice Blackmun wrote a separate dissenting opinion, noting that the petitioner had filed his petition out of time and that the Court should not dismiss a criminal conviction ""which was unsuccessfully appealed throughout the entire appeal process to which the petitioner was entitled as of right"".
The Court's decision in this case and other abatement cases has been criticized for allowing convicted criminal defendants to escape the collateral consequences of their convictions, including restitution orders.
The Court's decision in Durham was later overruled in Dove v. United States.

"Pennsylvania v. Nelson, 350 U.S. 497 (1956), was a United States Supreme Court case that established a precedent for the preemption of United States Federal law over State laws. The case was argued November 15–16, 1955 and the decision was handed down April 2, 1956. The State of Pennsylvania tried to convict a man of sedition under a state law, but a Federal law existed on the same subject. The Court ruled that the Federal law, the Smith Act, overruled the state law, the Pennsylvania Sedition Act, even though the state law was created before the federal law. Nelson, who was convicted under the state law, was therefore mistried.

"Kois v. Wisconsin, 408 U.S. 229 (1972), was a ruling by the U.S. Supreme Court in the case of the obscenity conviction of Milwaukee editor-publisher John Kois, whose underground newspaper Kaleidoscope had published two small photographs of pictures of nudes and a sexually-oriented poem entitled ""Sex Poem"" in 1968. The Supreme Court ruled that, in the context in which they appeared, the photographs were rationally related to a news article which they illustrated and were thus entitled to Fourteenth Amendment protection, and that the poem ""bears some of the earmarks of an attempt at serious art"" (whether successful or not), and thus was not obscene under the Roth v. United States test (""whether or not the 'dominant' theme of the material appeals to prurient interest""). In the words of the concurring opinion of Justice William O. Douglas, ""In this case, the vague umbrella of obscenity laws was used in an attempt to run a radical newspaper out of business and to impose a two-year sentence and a $2,000 fine upon its publisher. If obscenity laws continue in this uneven and uncertain enforcement, then the vehicle has been found for the suppression of any unpopular tract. The guarantee of free expression will thus be diluted and in its stead public discourse will only embrace that which has the approval of five members of this Court.""
As alluded to in Justice Douglas' opinion, by this time Kaleidoscope had already been driven out of business.",wiki
"Hunter v. Erickson, 393 U.S. 385 (1969), was a United States Supreme Court case.
The question in the case was ""whether the City of Akron, Ohio, has denied [a black citizen] the equal protection of its laws by amending the city charter to prevent the city council from implementing any ordinance dealing with racial, religious, or ancestral discrimination in housing without the approval of the majority of the voters of Akron.""
The Court held an amendment of a city charter to discriminate against minorities, and constitute a real, substantial, and invidious denial of the equal protection of the laws under the Fourteenth Amendment.
This amendment provided that an ordinance enacted by the city council would not be effective unless approved by a majority of the city voters at a regular or general election, and that any such ordinance in effect at the time of the charter amendment shall cease to be effective until approved by the voters, a fair housing ordinance having in fact been previously enacted by the city council; that ordinance  dealt with racial, religious, or ancestral discrimination in housing.
The amendment discriminated and violated the equal protection of the laws since, under the city's general system of enacting ordinances, an ordinance was effective a specified time after passage by the city council unless 10 percent of the voters petitioned for a referendum, and the amendment of the charter not only suspended the operation of the existing ordinance forbidding housing discrimination, but also made an explicit racial classification treating racial housing matters differently from other racial matters or other housing matters and made it more difficult to secure enactment of ordinances subject to the amendment, it being immaterial that the amendment drew no distinctions among racial and religious groups, since the amendment disadvantaged those who would benefit from laws barring racial, religious, or ancestral discriminations as against those who would bar other discriminations or who would otherwise regulate the real-estate market in their favor, and since the reality is that the law's impact falls on the minority and places special burdens on racial minorities within the governmental process.",wiki
"United States v. Utah Construction & Mining Company, 384 U.S. 394 (1966), is a United States Supreme Court case in which the Court held that ""(w)hen an administrative agency is acting in a judicial capacity and resolves disputed issues of fact properly before it which the parties have had an adequate opportunity to litigate, the courts have not hesitated to apply res judicata to enforce repose."" Utah Construction established a two-part test to determine whether res judicata effect should be given to an administrative determination. First, the agency proceeding must be examined to determine whether the agency was ""acting in a judicial capacity"" and whether the parties had ""an adequate opportunity to litigate"" the issues before the agency. Second, the general rules of res judicata must be applied to the case. Not all administrative adjudications, and not all judicial determinations, are entitled to res judicata effect. For the principles of res judicata to apply, administrative determinations, like court judgments, must be valid, final and on the merits.

"Kleindienst v. Mandel, 408 U.S. 753 (1972), was a decision by the United States Supreme Court, which held that the United States Attorney General has the right to refuse somebody's entry to the United States, as he has been empowered to do so in § 212(a)(28) of the Immigration and Nationality Act of 1952.
This action was brought to compel Attorney General Richard Kleindienst to grant a temporary nonimmigrant visa to a Belgian journalist and Marxian theoretician whom the American plaintiff-appellees, Ernest Mandel et al., had invited to participate in academic conferences and discussions in the US. The alien had been found ineligible for admission under §§ 212(a)(28)(D) and (G)(v) of the Immigration and Nationality Act of 1952, barring those who advocate or publish ""the economic, international, and governmental doctrines of world communism."" Kleindienst had declined to waive ineligibility as he has the power to do under § 212(d) of the Act, basing his decision on unscheduled activities engaged in by the alien on a previous visit to the United States, when a waiver was granted.

"California v. Hodari D., 499 U.S. 621 (1991), was a United States Supreme Court case where the Court held that a fleeing suspect is not ""seized"" under the terms of the Fourth Amendment unless the pursuing officers apply physical force to the suspect or the suspect submits to officers' demands to halt. Consequently, evidence that is discarded by a fleeing suspect prior to the point in time at which they are seized is not subject to the Fourth Amendment's exclusionary rule.",wiki
"J. D. B. v. North Carolina, 564 U.S. 261 (2011), was a case in which the Supreme Court of the United States held that age and mental status is relevant when determining police custody for Miranda purposes, overturning its prior ruling from seven years before. J. D. B. was a 13-year-old student enrolled in special education classes whom police had suspected of committing two robberies.  A police investigator visited J. D. B. at school, where he was interrogated by the investigator, a uniformed police officer, and school officials. J. D. B. subsequently confessed to his crimes and was convicted. J. D. B. was not given a Miranda warning during the interrogation, nor an opportunity to contact his legal guardian.
During the trial, attempts to suppress the statements given by J. D. B. because he was not given a Miranda warning were denied on the grounds that J. D. B. was not in police custody. J. D. B. appealed.
The North Carolina Supreme Court held that the Supreme Court's ruling in Yarborough v. Alvarado barred them from determining whether or not he was in custody based on his age. The court determined that a reasonable adult would've felt free to leave; consequently, J. D. B. was not in custody. Thus the court affirmed the ruling of the trial court. J. D. B. appealed, and the U.S. Supreme Court granted certiorari.
The U.S. Supreme Court argued that the age and mental status of an individual can take part in the psychological effect that he faces during police interaction. It's nearly exact to the reasoning of the 1970 Kentucky Supreme Court case of Allee v. Commonwealth, which held that the age and mental status of an individual is relevant in determining whether his statements are involuntary. Based on these reasons, the U.S. Supreme Court reversed the North Carolina Supreme Court and remanded for further proceedings. The North Carolina Supreme Court on remand then determined that J. D. B. was in custody, and remanded for further proceedings.",wiki

"United States v. X-Citement Video, Inc., 513 U.S. 64 (1994), was a federal criminal prosecution filed in the United States District Court for the Central District of California in Los Angeles against X-Citement Video and its owner, Rubin Gottesman, on three charges of trafficking in child pornography, specifically videos featuring the underaged Traci Lords. In 1989, a federal judge found Gottesman guilty and later sentenced him to one year in jail and a $100,000 fine.
The defense challenged the constitutionality of certain sections of the federal laws against child pornography, claiming they were unconstitutionally vague. On appeal, the United States Court of Appeals for the Ninth Circuit agreed and reversed the district decision in 1992.
The case was appealed again to the Supreme Court, which, in turn, by a 7-2 vote, reversed the ruling of the Ninth Circuit on November 29, 1994, because the relevant sections could be interpreted in a way that is constitutional.",wiki
"Sears, Roebuck & Co. v. Stiffel Co., 376 U.S. 225 (1964), was a United States Supreme Court case that limited state law on unfair competition when it prevents the copying of an item that is not covered by a patent.
Justice Hugo Black wrote for a unanimous Court that the US Constitution reserved power over intellectual property such as patents to the federal government exclusively. Since the trial court had found Stiffel's patent invalid as insufficiently inventive, its product design was thus in the public domain and no state law could be used to prevent Sears from copying it.
The Supreme Court made a similar ruling in a companion case decided the same day, Compco Corp. v. Day-Brite Lighting, Inc..
The two cases were the first decisions of the Supreme Court that the Supremacy Clause of the Constitution prevents from states passing their own patent or patent-like laws. The issue had been raised but not decided in Gibbons v. Ogden, in which Attorney General Wirt argued on behalf of the United States for federal patent preemption of New York's grant of a steamboat patent to Robert Fulton.",wiki
"Exxon Shipping Co. v. Baker, 554 U.S. 471 (2008), was a case decided by the Supreme Court of the United States. The Court ruled in a 5-3 decision that the punitive damages awarded to the victims of the Exxon Valdez oil spill should be reduced from $2.5 billion to $500 million.
The case was received by the Supreme Court of the United States from an appeal from the United States Court of Appeals for the Ninth Circuit. The Ninth Circuit had also ruled that Exxon could be held liable for the reckless conduct of the ship's captain, Joseph J. Hazelwood, who had left the bridge during the disaster and had been drinking vodka that evening. The Supreme Court was split 4–4 on the question of whether Exxon was liable for Hazelwood's action. The result of the split is that the Ninth Circuit's ruling on Exxon's respondeat superior liability for Hazelwood's conduct remains since Hazelwood acted in a managerial capacity under the Restatement (Second) of Torts Section 909(c) approach to punitive damages.
After considering the punitive damage policies of foreign nations, the Court reasoned that although punitive damages were warranted, they may not exceed what Exxon already paid to compensate victims for economic losses, which was about US$500 million. It held that a one-to-one ratio between punitive and compensatory damages was ""a fair upper limit"" in maritime cases that involved recklessness, compared to the lower liability of negligence or the higher liability of intentional conduct.  Its reasoning, ""The real problem, it seems, is the stark unpredictability of punitive awards,"" frustrates the goal of punitive damages, deterring reprehensible conduct, because predictable damages create an incentive to continue dangerous misconduct if the personal injury liability is less than the potential profit, as on the Ford Pinto. It suggested giving a ""bad man"" the chance to look ahead and to calculate the consequences of doing or not doing a bad act will deter harmful actions. He suggests the upper limits on punitive damages should be as predictable as the legislative range of criminal sentences, but no minimum for punitive damages were discussed.
Justice David Souter wrote for the majority, joined in full by Chief Justice John Roberts and Justices Antonin Scalia, Anthony Kennedy, and Clarence Thomas. Justice Samuel Alito took no part in the decision because he owns stock in ExxonMobil.
Justice Stevens wrote a separate opinion concurring in part and dissenting in part. His dissent advocated judicial restraint because Congress has chosen to regulate maritime tort law. Stevens wrote that the trial court award of $2.5 billion in punitive damages was not an abuse of discretion and should have been affirmed.
Of this reasoning, Boston University law professor Keith Hylton said, ""The court's elaborate and lengthy argument for the one-to-one ratio is troubling for several reasons. First, the whole discussion was largely unnecessary if the court really wanted to limit its decision to maritime cases. The court's majority appears to be trying to make the case for imposing the one-to-one ratio as a default rule in ordinary civil cases.""",wiki
"United States v. Park, 421 U.S. 658 (1975), was a case in the Supreme Court of the United States which held the Chief Executive Officer of a company may be criminally liable for contaminating food in violation of the Federal Food, Drug, and Cosmetic Act.
Sections 402 and 301 of the Act prohibited adulterating food held for sale in interstate commerce. Park was the CEO of Acme Markets, Inc. In 1971, the FDA notified Acme and Park that a 12-day inspection revealed insanitary conditions and vermin contamination.
Park failed to comply with a mandate from the FDA, under the Federal Food, Drugs, and Cosmetics Act, to keep conditions within his warehouses legally sanitary.
In the case, the Court found Park strictly liable for the unsanitary conditions that his company had created, arguing for strict liability under the rationale that the Federal Food, Drugs, and Cosmetics Act was a 'public welfare' statute. The Court concluded that as a welfare statute, the purpose was to prevent egregious social harm; therefore, the Defendant could be held strictly liable for the crime.
The Court held that if someone were to willingly be in charge of a company, and therefore its problems, then he or she willingly accepts the consequences of any illegal practices that his or her company or organization is involved in. An exception is made if the problem is impossible to fix.",wiki

The unanimous Supreme Court agreed with the 10th Circuit that terminating a pro-consumer joint venture without a legitimate business justification could constitute illegal monopolization.

Nation Enterprises, 471 U.S. 539 (1985), was a United States Supreme Court decision in which public interest in learning about a historical figure's impressions of a historic event was held not to be sufficient to show fair use of material otherwise protected by copyright. Defendant, The Nation, had summarized and quoted substantially from A Time to Heal, President Gerald Ford's forthcoming memoir of his decision to pardon former president Richard Nixon. When Harper & Row, who held the rights to A Time to Heal, brought suit, The Nation asserted that its use of the book was protected under the doctrine of fair use, because of the great public interest in a historical figure's account of a historic incident. The Court rejected this argument holding that the right of first publication was important enough to find in favor of Harper.",wiki
"United States v. Nixon, 418 U.S. 683 (1974), was a landmark decision of the Supreme Court of the United States in which the Court unanimously ordered President Richard Nixon to deliver tape recordings and other subpoenaed materials related to the Watergate scandal to a federal district court. Decided on July 24, 1974, the ruling was important to the late stages of the Watergate scandal, amidst an ongoing process to impeach Richard Nixon. United States v.

"Copperweld Corp. v.

Section 1 of the Sherman Act states that ""Every contract, combination in the form of trust or otherwise, or conspiracy, in restraint of trade or commerce among the several States, or with foreign nations, is declared to be illegal."" However, for a condition of conspiracy to exist, there must be at least two parties involved.

"New York Times Co. v. Sullivan, 376 U.S. 254 (1964), was a landmark U.S. Supreme Court decision ruling that the freedom of speech protections in the First Amendment to the U.S. Constitution restrict the ability of public officials to sue for defamation. The decision held that if a plaintiff in a defamation lawsuit is a public official or candidate for public office, then not only must they prove the normal elements of defamation—publication of a false defamatory statement to a third party—they must also prove that the statement was made with ""actual malice"", meaning the defendant either knew the statement was false or recklessly disregarded whether it might be false. New York Times Co. v. Sullivan is frequently ranked as one of the greatest Supreme Court decisions of the modern era.
The underlying case began in 1960, when The New York Times published a full-page advertisement by supporters of Martin Luther King Jr. that criticized the police in Montgomery, Alabama, for their treatment of civil rights movement protesters. The ad had several inaccuracies regarding facts such as the number of times King had been arrested during the protests, what song the protesters had sung, and whether students had been expelled for participating. Based on the inaccuracies, Montgomery police commissioner L. B. Sullivan sued the Times for defamation in the local Alabama county court. After the judge ruled that the advertisement's inaccuracies were defamatory per se, the jury returned a verdict in favor of Sullivan and awarded him $500,000 in damages. The Times appealed first to the Supreme Court of Alabama, which affirmed the verdict, and then to the U.S. Supreme Court, which agreed to hear the case.
In March 1964, the Court issued a 9–0 decision holding that the Alabama court's verdict violated the First Amendment. The Court reasoned that defending the principle of wide-open debate will inevitably include ""vehement, caustic, and...unpleasantly sharp attacks on government and public officials."" The Supreme Court's decision, and its adoption of the actual malice standard, reduced the financial exposure from potential defamation claims and frustrated efforts by public officials to use these claims to suppress political criticism. The Supreme Court has since extended Sullivan's higher legal standard for defamation to all ""public figures"". This has made it extremely difficult for a public figure to win a defamation lawsuit in the United States.

"Safford Unified School District v. Redding, 557 U.S. 364 (2009), was a case in which the Supreme Court of the United States held that a strip search of a middle school student by school officials violated the Fourth Amendment to the U.S. Constitution, which prohibits unreasonable searches and seizures.
On October 8, 2003, the assistant principal of Safford Middle School in Safford, Arizona, informed 13-year-old Savana Redding that another student had accused her of distributing prescription-strength ibuprofen, which was disallowed without prior permission by school rules. Redding denied this accusation, and after a search of her belongings did not reveal any pills, school officials instructed her to remove her outer clothing and pull out her bra and underpants, which also did not reveal any pills.
Redding's mother sued the Safford Unified School District and the school officials who searched her daughter, arguing that they had violated the Fourth Amendment. On June 25, 2009, in an 8–1 decision authored by Justice David Souter, the Supreme Court held that the search failed to meet the ""reasonable suspicion"" standard for searches of students in a school setting established by the Court in New Jersey v. T. L. O. (1985), stating that the school lacked reasons to suspect either that the drugs presented a danger or that they were concealed in her underwear. However, the Court also found that because there was sufficient doubt as to whether the law was clearly established at the time of the search, the school officials were shielded from liability by qualified immunity.
The case garnered nationwide interest and sparked debates over the extent to which school officials should enforce zero-tolerance policies in schools. Justice Ruth Bader Ginsburg was the only female justice at the time and discussed the case in an interview while a decision was still pending; observers have described Ginsburg's role in the case as emphasizing the need for more diversity on the Supreme Court.",wiki

The statutes were challenged under the Fourteenth Amendment.  The Court held that the statutes acted as deprivations of plaintiff's property without due process.
The Court noted that seizure without notice and the opportunity for a hearing is acceptable only under limited circumstances:

The seizure is necessary for an important public or government interest,
There is a need for prompt action, and
The seizure is initiated by an agent of the government.
These exceptions would apply (for example) when property is tainted food, misbranded drugs or unpaid taxes needed to fund a war.",wiki

"Terry v. Adams, 345 U.S. 461 (1953), was a United States Supreme Court decision that held white-only pre-primary elections to be unconstitutional. It was the last in a series of court cases addressing the system of white primaries designed to disenfranchise African-American voters in the southern United States.
In the first of these cases, Nixon v. Herndon (1927), Lawrence Aaron Nixon, a black physician, sued for damages under federal civil rights laws after being denied a ballot in a Democratic party primary election on the basis of race. The Court found in his favor on the basis of the Fourteenth Amendment, which guarantees equal protection under the law, while not discussing his Fifteenth Amendment claim. After Texas amended its statute to authorize the political party's state executive committee to set voting qualifications, Nixon sued again; in Nixon v. Condon (1932), the Court again found in his favor on the basis of the Fourteenth Amendment. Following this decision, the Democratic Party's state convention instituted a rule that only whites could vote in its primary elections; the Court unanimously upheld this rule as constitutional in Grovey v. Townsend (1935), distinguishing the discrimination by a private organization from that of the state in the previous primary cases.
The Court reversed course, however, with Smith v. Allwright (1944), another of the Texas primary cases. In United States v. Classic (1941), the Court had ruled that primary elections were an essential part of the electoral process, opening Grovey to review. Under this reasoning, the Court found that denying non-white voters a ballot in primary elections was a violation of the Fifteenth Amendment, overturning Grovey.
Terry v. Adams formed the last of these cases. The petitioners, qualified black voters in Fort Bend County including John Terry, Charlie Roberts, Willie Melton, and Arizona Fleming, sued an organization known as the Jaybird Democratic Association, which since 1889 had organized white-only pre-elections for county offices; the winners of these pre-elections invariably won the subsequent official elections. The Court found for the plaintiffs but reached no majority opinion. Justices Hugo Black, William O. Douglas, and Harold H. Burton found that an election that effectively excluded black voters violated the Fifteenth Amendment, while Tom C. Clark, Stanley F. Reed, and Robert H. Jackson found in a concurring opinion that the Jaybirds effectively formed an auxiliary of the Democratic Party, bringing the case within the scope of Smith v. Allwright. Justice Sherman Minton dissented.",wiki

"Santa Clara Pueblo v. Martinez, 436 U.S. 49 (1978), was a landmark case in the area of federal Indian law involving issues of great importance to the meaning of tribal sovereignty in the contemporary United States. The Supreme Court sustained a law passed by the governing body of the Santa Clara Pueblo that explicitly discriminated on the basis of sex. In so doing, the Court advanced a theory of tribal sovereignty that weighed the interests of tribes sufficient to justify a law that, had it been passed by a state legislature or Congress, would have almost certainly been struck down as a violation of equal protection.

"United States v. Alfonso D. Lopez, Jr., 514 U.S. 549 (1995), was a landmark case of the United States Supreme Court that struck down the Gun-Free School Zones Act of 1990 (GFSZA) as it was outside of Congress's power to regulate interstate commerce. It was the first case since 1937 in which the Court held that Congress had exceeded its power under the Commerce Clause.
The case arose from a San Antonio high school student's challenge to the GFSZA, which banned possession of handguns within 1,000 feet (300 meters) of a school. In a majority decision joined by four other justices, Chief Justice William Rehnquist held that Lopez' possession of the gun was not economic activity and its scope was not sufficiently cabined, and so was outside the broad reach of the Commerce Clause. After the Lopez decision, the GFSZA was amended to specifically only apply to guns that had been moved via interstate or foreign commerce.
Though it did not reverse any past ruling about the meaning of the Commerce Clause, Lopez raised serious questions as to how far the Court might be willing to go in curbing Congress' commerce powers. This decision was a slight return to the original commerce clause precedent set in Gibbons v. Ogden in which Justice Marshall held that federal law may control state law only when necessary to effectively exercise an enumerated power, and it may not otherwise deny the states' authority to govern in the same area. The Court would later further limit congressional powers under the Commerce Clause in United States v. Morrison (2000).

"Citizens United v. Federal Election Commission, 558 U.S. 310 (2010), is a landmark decision of the Supreme Court of the United States regarding campaign finance laws and free speech under the First Amendment to the U.S. Constitution. The court held 5–4 that the freedom of speech clause of the First Amendment prohibits the government from restricting independent expenditures for political campaigns by corporations, nonprofit organizations, labor unions, and other associations.
The majority held that the prohibition of all independent expenditures by corporations and unions in the Bipartisan Campaign Reform Act violated the First Amendment. The ruling barred restrictions on corporations, unions, and nonprofit organizations from independent expenditures, allowing groups to independently support political candidates with financial resources. In a dissenting opinion, Justice John Paul Stevens argued that the court's ruling represented ""a rejection of the common sense of the American people, who have recognized a need to prevent corporations from undermining self government"".
The decision remains highly controversial, generating much public discussion and receiving strong support or opposition from various politicians, commentators, and advocacy groups. Senator Mitch McConnell commended the decision, arguing that it represented ""an important step in the direction of restoring the First Amendment rights"". By contrast, then-president President Barack Obama stated that the decision ""gives the special interests and their lobbyists even more power in Washington"".

"Waters v. Churchill, 511 U.S. 661 (1994), is a United States Supreme Court case concerning the First Amendment rights of public employees in the workplace. By a 7–2 margin the justices held that it was not necessary to determine what a nurse at a public hospital had actually said while criticizing a supervisor's staffing practices to coworkers, as long as the hospital had formed a reasonable belief as to the content of her remarks and reasonably believed that they could be disruptive to its operations. They vacated a Seventh Circuit Court of Appeals ruling in her favor, and ordered the case remanded to district court to determine instead if the nurse had been fired for the speech or other reasons, per the Court's ruling two decades prior in Mt. Healthy City School District Board of Education v. Doyle.
The case had first been brought by Cheryl Churchill, a nurse in the obstetrics ward at McDonough District Hospital, operated by the city of Macomb, Illinois. During a dinner break one night in early 1987, she had been talking with another nurse who was considering transferring to obstetrics. In that conversation she made statements critical of cross-training practices recently implemented by the hospital's nursing supervisor, Cindy Waters, and referred to personal issues between the two. Another nurse who overheard the conversation believed Churchill's comments about Waters had dissuaded her interlocutor from the transfer, and reported it to Waters. After an investigation in which Churchill alleged she was never asked about what she had said, she was fired.
There were four separate opinions. Sandra Day O'Connor wrote for a four-justice plurality that the government has a lower obligation to respect constitutional rights when it acts as employer rather than as the sovereign. Accordingly, in that situation it should not be required to meet a due process standard greater than the reasonableness of its own finding of fact. David Souter added a short concurring opinion qualifying the plurality, which he said was in fact a majority, with his insistence that in such cases the government must demonstrate that its understanding of what the employee said was not only a reasonable belief but a truthful one. Antonin Scalia concurred as well, but harshly criticized O'Connor's opinion. He read it as requiring a procedural handling of every possible adverse personnel action where First Amendment rights might be implicated, providing ""more questions than answers"". John Paul Stevens' dissent argued that the First Amendment required that the lower court determine exactly what Churchill had said before ruling on whether it was protected.
Outside commentators have also been critical of the decision, since it might discourage whistleblowers. In addition to echoing Stevens' concerns, they have seen it as abandoning any concern for the truth, imposing a heavy burden on a plaintiff, relying on an overly narrow conception of the public's interest, and possibly discouraging people from entering public service. The decision resulted in a lower court changing its ruling in a high-profile case involving controversial academic Leonard Jeffries.",wiki

In his concurrence/dissent, Justice Robert Jackson famously opined, ""To bring in a lawyer means a real peril to solution of the crime because, under our adversary system, he deems that his sole duty is to protect his client—guilty or innocent—and that, in such a capacity, he owes no duty whatever to help society solve its crime problem. Under this conception of criminal procedure, any lawyer worth his salt will tell the suspect in no uncertain terms to make no statement to police under any circumstances.""
In this case, a defendant was subjected to rigorous interrogation methods, including being forced to sleep on the floor, resulting in a confession to having committed murder. The Supreme Court ruled that the confession was involuntary and reversed his conviction.

"Aikens v. California, 406 U.S. 813 (1972), was a decision of the United States Supreme Court where a petitioner (in the U.S. Supreme Court, the plaintiff (Aikens) is called the petitioner and the defendant (the State of California) is called the respondent) was appealing his conviction and death sentence. After oral argument had been made on the case, but before the court decided on it, the Supreme Court of California in People v. Anderson, declared the death penalty unconstitutional under the state constitution.  This made his appeal unnecessary because the decision in Anderson

declared capital punishment in California unconstitutional under Art. 1, 6, of the state constitution... The California Supreme Court declared in the Anderson case that its decision was fully retroactive and stated that any prisoner currently under sentence of death could petition a superior court to modify its judgment. [Aikens] thus no longer faces a realistic threat of execution... [emphasis added]
The Supreme Court would decide later that year, in Furman v. Georgia, that the Death Penalty was under certain circumstances unconstitutional.

"Quantity of Books v. Kansas, 378 U.S. 205 (1964), is an in rem United States Supreme Court decision on First Amendment questions relating to the forfeiture of obscene material. By a 7–2 margin, the Court held that a seizure of the books was unconstitutional, since no hearing had been held on whether the books were obscene, and it reversed a Kansas Supreme Court decision that upheld the seizure.
The case arose several years earlier when police in Junction City, Kansas raided an adult bookstore. The state's Attorney General, William M. Ferguson, had previously filed an information with the county court listing 51 titles published by Nightstand Books as allegedly obscene; at the bookstore, 31 of those titles found, and 1,175 books were seized. These procedures were believed to be in keeping with the Supreme Court's recent Marcus v. Search Warrant decision, which held that some sort of judicial review was necessary to determine if seized material was obscene prior to seizure.
Justice William Brennan wrote for a four-justice plurality that considered the case strictly on procedural grounds, without reaching the question of the books' obscenity. It could, he said, operate as a form of prior restraint. In one of two separate concurrences, Justice Hugo Black reaffirmed his earlier blanket opposition to all legal suppression of obscenity, in which he was joined by William O. Douglas. Justice Potter Stewart said that the books in question were not hardcore pornography, which was the only material that he could consider holding to be unprotected by the First Amendment in Quantity of Books's companion case, Jacobellis v. Ohio (where he had also defined it with his oft-quoted line ""I know it when I see it"").
In dissent, Justice John Marshall Harlan II wrote for himself and Tom Clark in faulting Brennan's application of the precedents he relied on. He also disputed whether the procedure was truly prior restraint, since it did not review the material prior to publication. The Court, he concluded, was unfairly denying Kansas the full range of legal tools it might otherwise have had to pursue if it had decided it was an important state interest.",wiki

"Train v. City of New York, 420 U.S. 35 (1975), was a statutory interpretation case in the Supreme Court of the United States. Although one commentator characterizes the case's implications as meaning ""[t]he president cannot frustrate the will of Congress by killing a program through impoundment,"" the Court majority itself made no categorical constitutional pronouncement about impoundment power but focused on the statute's language and legislative history. The words ""Constitution,"" ""separation of powers,"" ""separated powers"" appear nowhere in the 8-justice majority opinion. The Court's opinion approaches the case as a question of statutory interpretation, albeit one with implications for the American system of checks and balances.
In this case, President Richard Nixon was of the view that the administration was not obligated to disburse all funds allocated by Congress to states seeking federal monetary assistance under the Federal Water Pollution Control Act Amendments of 1972 and ordered the impoundment of substantial amounts of environmental protection funds for a program he vetoed, and which had been overridden by Congress. Russell E. Train, the administrator of the EPA at the time, complied with the order. Several prospective recipients of the funds (which were intended to subsidize construction of municipal sewers and water treatment works), including the city of New York and several other municipalities, promptly sued, seeking judgment that the administrator was obligated to disburse full amounts authorized and an order directing him to make those allotments.
In interpreting the statute and its key terms ""sums"" (not all sums) and ""not to exceed,"" the Court declined to interpret the statute as a congressional grant of discretion to the President to order the impoundment of substantial amounts of environmental protection funds for a program in these circumstances. The Court's review of the statute's legislative history revealed no intention to grant impoundment authority.
The case arose from facts which pre-date the Congressional Budget and Impoundment Control Act of 1974, though the case was argued after the passing of the 1974 Act. The case showed that the presidential power of impoundment, even without the 1974 Act, was limited by a fair reading of the words Congress chose in its appropriation act. The President is required to carry out the full objectives or scope of programs for which budget authority is provided by the United States Congress. In this case, the President could not order the impoundment of substantial amounts of environmental protection funds for a program he had vetoed, and which Congress had overridden. This finding closed a potential loophole in the Act.",wiki

"Massiah v. United States, 377 U.S. 201 (1964), was a case in which the Supreme Court of the United States held that the Sixth Amendment to the United States Constitution prohibits the government from eliciting statements from the defendant about themselves after the point that the Sixth Amendment right to counsel attaches.
In Massiah, the defendant had been indicted on a federal narcotics charge. He retained a lawyer, pleaded not guilty, and was released on bail. A co-defendant, after deciding to cooperate with the government, invited Massiah to sit in his car and discuss the crime he was indicted on, during which the government listened in via a radio transmitter. During the conversation, Massiah made several incriminating statements, and those statements were introduced at trial to be used against him.
Massiah appealed his conviction, which was affirmed in part by the Court of Appeals for the Second Circuit. The Supreme Court granted certiorari and reversed, holding that the statements made by the defendant outside the presence of his attorney must be suppressed.
The Massiah rule applies to the use of testimonial evidence in criminal proceedings deliberately elicited by the police from a defendant after formal charges have been filed. The events that trigger the Sixth Amendment safeguards under Massiah are (1) the commencement of adversarial criminal proceedings and (2) deliberate elicitation of information from the defendant by governmental agents.
The Sixth Amendment guarantees a defendant a right to counsel in all criminal prosecutions. The purposes of the Sixth Amendment right to counsel are to protect a defendant's right to a fair trial and to assure that our adversarial system of justice functions properly by providing competent counsel as an advocate for the defendant in his contest against the “prosecutorial forces” of the state.
The Sixth Amendment right “attaches” once the government has committed itself to the prosecution of the case by the initiation of adversarial judicial proceedings ""by way of formal charge, preliminary hearing, indictment, information or arraignment,"". Determining whether a particular event or proceeding constitutes the commencement of adversarial criminal proceedings requires both an examination of the rules of criminal procedure for the jurisdiction in which the crime is charged and the Supreme Court cases dealing with the issue of when formal prosecution begins. Once adversarial criminal proceedings commence the right to counsel applies to all critical stages of the prosecution and investigation. A critical stage is ""any stage of the prosecution, formal or informal, in court or out, where counsel's absence might derogate from the accused's right to a fair trial.""
Government attempts to obtain incriminating statement related to the offense charged from the defendant by overt interrogation or surreptitious means is a critical stage and any information thus obtained is subject to suppression unless the government can show that an attorney was present or the defendant knowingly, voluntarily and intelligently waived his right to counsel.
Deliberate elicitation is defined as the intentional creation of circumstances by government agents that are likely to produce incriminating information from the defendant. Clearly express questioning (interrogation) would qualify but the concept also extends to surreptitious attempts to acquire information from the defendant through the use of undercover agents or paid informants.
The definition of ""deliberate elicitation""  is not the same as the definition of ""interrogation"" under the Miranda rule established in Miranda v. Arizona. Miranda interrogation includes express questioning and any actions or statements that an officer would reasonably foresee as likely to cause an incriminating response. Massiah applies to express questioning and any attempt to deliberately and intentionally obtain incriminating information from the defendant regarding the crime charged. The difference is purposeful creation of an environment likely to produce incriminating information (Massiah) and action likely to induce an incriminating response even if that was not the officer's purpose or intent (Miranda).
The Sixth Amendment right to counsel is offense specific - the right only applies to post commencement attempts to obtain information relating to the crime charged. The right does not extend to uncharged offenses even those that are factually related to the charged crime.
As noted, information obtained in violation of the defendant's Sixth Amendment right to counsel is subject to suppression unless the government can establish that the defendant waived his right to counsel. The waiver must be knowing, intelligent and voluntary. A valid Miranda waiver operates as a waiver of Sixth Amendment right.",wiki

"Leland v. Oregon, 343 U.S. 790 (1952), was a United States Supreme Court case in which the Court upheld the constitutionality of placing the burden of persuasion on the defendant when they argue an insanity defense in a criminal trial. This differed from previous federal common law established in Davis v. United States, in which the court held that if the defense raised an insanity defense, the prosecution must prove sanity beyond a reasonable doubt, but Davis was not a United States constitutional ruling, so only limited federal cases, but not state cases.: 17  Oregon had a very high burden on defense, that insanity be proved beyond a reasonable doubt.: 17  At that time, twenty other states also placed the burden of persuasion on the defense for an insanity defense.: 17 
The defendant was convicted of killing a fifteen-year-old girl in Multnomah County. After being arrested for auto theft, the defendant asked for a homicide officer, verbally confessed to the murder, took the police to the scene of the crime, and signed a written confession. After being indicted, he then spoke to a lawyer for the first time.  At trial, a jury convicted him and recommended the death penalty.
Oregon law required the defendant required proof of insanity beyond a reasonable doubt.

"Roth v. United States, 354 U.S. 476 (1957), along with its companion case Alberts v. California, was a landmark decision of the Supreme Court of the United States which redefined the constitutional test for determining what constitutes obscene material unprotected by the First Amendment. The Court, in an opinion by Justice William J. Brennan Jr. created a test to determine what constituted obscene material: Whether the average person, applying contemporary community standards would find that the material appeals to a prurient interest in sex, and whether the material was utterly without redeeming social value. Although the Court upheld Roth’s conviction and allowed some obscenity prosecutions, it drastically loosened obscenity laws. The decision dissatisfied both social conservatives who thought that it had gone too far in tolerating sexual imagery, and liberals who felt that it infringed on the rights of consenting adults.
The decision was superseded by Miller v. California which removed the ""utterly without redeeming social value"" test, and replaced it with without ""serious literary, artistic, political, or scientific value"".

"Industrial Union Department v. American Petroleum Institute (also known as the Benzene Case), 448 U.S. 607 (1980), was a case decided by the Supreme Court of the United States.  This case represented a challenge to the OSHA practice of regulating carcinogens by setting the exposure limit ""at the lowest technologically feasible level that will not impair the viability of the industries regulated.""  OSHA selected that standard because it believed that (1) it could not determine a safe exposure level and that (2) the authorizing statute did not require it to quantify such a level. The AFL Industrial Union Department served as the petitioner; the American Petroleum Institute was the respondent. A plurality on the Court, led by Justice Stevens, wrote that the authorizing statute did indeed require OSHA to demonstrate a significant risk of harm (albeit not with mathematical certainty) in order to justify setting a particular exposure level.
Perhaps more important than the specific holding of the case, the Court noted in dicta that if the government's interpretation of the authorizing statute had been correct, it might violate the nondelegation doctrine.

"United States v. Florida East Coast Railway Co., 410 U.S. 224 (1973), was a case decided by the United States Supreme Court.
Due to a chronic freight car shortage, Congress had enlarged the scope of the Interstate Commerce Commission's authority to prescribe per diem rate charges for the use of one company's freight car by another, thus giving an incentive to each company to use the cars more efficiently or to acquire more freight cars. The Commission, in passing the regulation, had allowed railroads 60 days to file statements of position on the matter. The Commission had said: ""that any party requesting oral hearing shall set forth with specificity the need therefore and the evidence to be adduced.""  Several railroads filed statements requesting oral hearings, but the Commission did not hold further hearings and overruled the requests.
Two railroad companies brought an action in the Middle District of Florida to set aside the per diem rates that had been established because they had only been allowed to make written submissions during ""hearings"" for the proposed rule and not oral arguments. The District Court found that the Interstate Commerce Act required that the Interstate Commerce Commission act in accordance with Administrative Procedure Act, 5 U.S.C. Sec. 556(d), which required that parties would not be ""prejudiced"" by an agency's decision to receive all submissions of evidence in written form.
The Supreme Court reversed the District Court's decision. Justice Rehnquist delivered the opinion, explaining that Section 1(14)(a) of the Interstate Commerce Act which had enlarged the Commission's authority to pass regulations ""after hearing"" was not a requirement that the ICC allow oral arguments in its rulemaking proceedings and that the hearing requirement had been met.
The Court distinguished between administrative rulemaking and administrative adjudications. Since there had been no effort to single out a particular railroad, the court found the agency's action was of a basically legislative type judgment as opposed to an adjudication which could entail due process hearing rights.
The Court referred to its decision in Bi-Metallic Investment Co. v. State Board of Equalization in which it held that no hearing at all was constitutionally required prior to a decision by state tax officers in Colorado to increase the valuation of all taxable property in Denver by a substantial amount.
Justice Douglas joined by Justice Stewart dissented finding that the Railroads had not been afforded hearings guaranteed by Section 1(14)(a) of the Interstate Commerce Act and 5 U.S.C. Sections 553, 556, and 557.

"Carey v. Musladin, 549 U.S. 70 (2006), is a United States Supreme Court case involving the standard for when a federal court can grant habeas corpus relief to overturn a criminal conviction based on the state court's misapplication of established federal law.  At issue was whether a criminal defendant's constitutional right to a fair trial was violated when relatives of the alleged victim were permitted to sit in the courtroom as spectators during the trial, wearing buttons that displayed the victim's image.
The Supreme Court ruled that the state court did not unreasonably apply clearly established federal law when it upheld the conviction.  The Court's prior rulings on when courtroom practices prejudiced the right to a fair trial were limited to state-sponsored conduct, and had consequently left it an open question regarding the conduct of spectators.

"Thor Power Tool Company v. Commissioner, 439 U.S. 522 (1979), was a United States Supreme Court case in which the Court upheld IRS regulations limiting how taxpayers could write down inventory.
Thor manufactured equipment using multiple parts that it produced.  It capitalized the costs of these parts when produced.  When it had inventories of parts in excess of production needs, the company's accounting practice was to write down those inventories, taking a loss based on management judgment.
However, IRS regulations accepted this ""lower of cost or market"" method for tax purposes only if the taxpayer could demonstrate a reduced market price, or the goods were defective or ""subnormal"".  It did not permit companies to write down goods simply because they were not selling them.
In court, the company argued that its deduction for loss should be allowed for tax purposes because it was permitted for accounting purposes.  But the Court upheld the IRS regulations, saying, ""There is no presumption that an inventory practice conformable to 'generally accepted accounting principles' is valid for tax purposes. Such a presumption is insupportable in light of the statute, this Court's past decisions, and the differing objectives of tax and financial accounting.""",wiki
"Oneida Indian Nation of New York v. County of Oneida, 414 U.S. 661 (1974), is a landmark decision by the United States Supreme Court concerning aboriginal title in the United States. The original suit in this matter was the first modern-day Native American land claim litigated in the federal court system rather than before the Indian Claims Commission. It was also the first to go to final judgement.
The Supreme Court held that there is federal subject-matter jurisdiction for possessory land claims brought by Indian tribes based upon aboriginal title, the Nonintercourse Act, and Indian treaties. In delivering the opinion of the Court, Associate Justice Byron White wrote that jurisdiction for such suits arose both from 28 U.S.C. § 1331, conferring jurisdiction for cases arising under the Constitution, laws, or treaties of the United States and 28 U.S.C. § 1362, conferring similar jurisdiction to cases brought by Indian tribes regardless of the amount in controversy.
The case is often referred to as Oneida I because it is the first of three times the Oneida Indian Nation reached the Supreme Court in litigating its land rights claims. It was followed by County of Oneida v. Oneida Indian Nation of New York State (Oneida II) (1985), rejecting all of the affirmative defenses raised by the counties in the same action, and City of Sherrill v. Oneida Indian Nation of New York (Sherrill) (2005), rejecting the tribe's attempt in a later lawsuit to reassert tribal sovereignty over parcels of land reacquired by the tribe in fee simple.",wiki
"United States v. Seeger, 380 U.S. 163 (1965), was a case in which the United States Supreme Court ruled that the exemption from the military draft for conscientious objectors could be reserved not only for those professing conformity with the moral directives of a supreme being but also for those whose views on war derived from a ""sincere and meaningful belief which occupies in the life of its possessor a place parallel to that filled by the God of those"" who had routinely gotten the exemption. 
The Court reasoned that ""both morals and sound policy require that the state should not violate the conscience of the individual"" and that ""liberty of conscience has a moral and social value which makes it worthy of preservation at the hands of the state."" Additionally, that if this principle is violated to preserve the ""life"" of the state that it puts into question whether the state will lose its ""life"" as a result. 
The case resolved, on diverse but related grounds, three cases, each involving conviction for failure to accept induction into the armed forces on the part of someone who sought conscientious-objector status without ""belong[ing] to an orthodox religious sect"". The accused, whose cases were otherwise unrelated, were Arno Sascha Jakobson, Forest Britt Peter, and Daniel Andrew Seeger; it was Seeger's case that gave its name to the multi-case decision.

"Brown v. Texas, 443 U.S. 47 (1979), was a United States Supreme Court case in which the Court determined that the defendant's arrest in El Paso, Texas, for a refusal to identify himself, after being seen and questioned in a high crime area, was not based on a reasonable suspicion of wrongdoing and thus violated the Fourth Amendment. It is an important case for Stop and Identify statutes in the United States.
The decision was written by Chief Justice Warren Burger and unanimously supported by the other justices. His summary of the factual elements of the case includes the following:

Two police officers, while cruising near noon in a patrol car, observed appellant and another man walking away from one another in an alley in an area with a high incidence of drug traffic. They stopped and asked appellant to identify himself and explain what he was doing. One officer testified that he stopped appellant because the situation ""looked suspicious and we had never seen that subject in that area before."" The officers did not claim to suspect appellant of any specific misconduct, nor did they have any reason to believe that he was armed. When appellant refused to identify himself, he was arrested for violation of a Texas statute which makes it a criminal act for a person to refuse to give his name and address to an officer ""who has lawfully stopped him and requested the information.""
The finding held that:

The application of the Texas statute to detain appellant and require him to identify himself violated the Fourth Amendment because the officers lacked any reasonable suspicion to believe that appellant was engaged or had engaged in criminal conduct. Detaining appellant to require him to identify himself constituted a seizure of his person subject to the requirement of the Fourth Amendment that the seizure be ""reasonable.""
While the application of the relevant Texas law was held unconstitutional in the case, the constitutional status of the law itself was not addressed.
The statute in question, Tex. Penal Code § 38.02(a) has since been revised to only make it a crime to refuse to identify oneself after being lawfully arrested.",wiki
"Miranda v. Arizona, 384 U.S. 436 (1966), was a landmark decision of the U.S. Supreme Court in which the Court ruled that law enforcement in the United States must warn a person of their constitutional rights before interrogating them, or else the person's statements cannot be used as evidence at their trial. Specifically, the Court held that under the Fifth Amendment to the U.S. Constitution, the government cannot use a person's statements made in response to an interrogation while in police custody as evidence at the person's criminal trial unless they can show that the person was informed of the right to consult with a lawyer before and during questioning, and of the right against self-incrimination before police questioning, and that the defendant not only understood these rights but also voluntarily waived them before answering questions.
Miranda was viewed by many as a radical change in American criminal law, since the Fifth Amendment was traditionally understood only to protect Americans against formal types of compulsion to confess, such as threats of contempt of court. It has had a significant impact on law enforcement in the United States, by making what became known as the Miranda warning part of routine police procedure to ensure that suspects were informed of their rights, which would become known as ""Miranda rights"". The concept of ""Miranda warnings"" quickly caught on across American law enforcement agencies, who came to call the practice ""Mirandizing"".
Pursuant to the U.S. Supreme Court decision Berghuis v. Thompkins (2010), criminal suspects who are aware of their right to silence and to an attorney but choose not to ""unambiguously"" invoke them may find any subsequent voluntary statements treated as an implied waiver of their rights, and used as or as part of evidence. At least one scholar has argued that Thompkins ""fully undermined"" Miranda.",wiki

"Bellotti v. Baird, 443 U.S. 622 (1979), is a United States Supreme Court case that ruled 8-1 that teenagers do not have to secure parental consent to obtain an abortion.
The Court elaborated on its parental consent decision of 1976. It implies that states may be able to require a pregnant, unmarried minor to obtain parental consent to an abortion if the state law provides an alternative procedure to parental approval, such as letting the minor seek a state judge's approval instead. The plurality opinion declined to extend the full right to minors to seek and obtain an abortion, which was granted to adult women in Roe v. Wade. The Court rejected the extension to minors by placing emphasis on the especially vulnerable nature of children, their ""inability to make critical decisions in an informed and mature manner; and the importance of the parental role in child rearing."" Ironically, the plurality opinion allows a judge to determine that a pregnant minor is unable to make critical decisions regarding a fetus and must instead become a parent—thereby forcing the minor to make critical decisions regarding another child.
Consent must be obtained from the parent(s) for a minor to have a nonemergency abortion and the parent(s) must know about the judicial proceedings, unless no parent(s) are available.  If the judge decides the minor is mature and making an informed and capable decision, he can still deny the abortion based on his own decision.
Justice Lewis F. Powell Jr., joined by Chief Justice Warren E. Burger, Justice Potter Stewart, and Justice William Rehnquist argued there are three reasons why children aren't like adults: the vulnerability of children, the lack of critical decision making, and reliance on parents guidance for their children upbringing.
Justice John P. Stevens, joined by Justice William J. Brennan Jr., Justice Thurgood Marshall, and Justice Harry Blackmun, concluded that the Massachusetts statute was unconstitutional because first it allows for the court to deny the abortion despite the courts decision on the minor's maturity. Second, consent was required in every case without giving the minor an option to an independent case to prove she was mature, leading to an 'absolute third-party veto'.
If a state requires a pregnant minor to obtain consent of one or both parents, another alternative option must be available for the minor to receive the abortion. The alternative process has four requirements: (1) the minor is permitted to demonstrate her maturity and informed decision making on having the abortion without parental consent, (2) if the minor does not prove maturity, she has the ability to convince the judge that the abortion would be the best decision for her (3) the minor must remain anonymous, and (4) the process must be expedited to ensure the abortion will be  possible to obtain.
Justice Rehnquist concurred on stare decisis grounds while continuing to oppose the constitutional right to an abortion.",wiki

"Turner v. Safley, 482 U.S. 78 (1987), was a U.S. Supreme Court decision involving the constitutionality of two Missouri prison regulations. One of the prisoners' claims related to the fundamental right to marry, and the other related to freedom of speech (in sending/receiving letters). The court held that a regulation preventing inmates from marrying without permission violated their constitutional right to marry because it was not logically related to a legitimate penological concern, but a prohibition on inmate-to-inmate correspondence was justified by prison security needs.
The case has been cited as precedent, establishing the ""Turner Test"" for constitutional challenges to prison regulations. According to the test, a prison regulation is constitutional if it satisfies four factors:

There is a rational connection to a legitimate government interest;
There are alternative means for prisoners to exercise their right(s);
Accommodation of the right(s) would have excessive ""ripple effects""; and
There are no ""ready alternatives.""

She argued that the firm denied her partnership because she did not fit the partners' idea of what a female employee should look and act like. The employer failed to prove that it would have denied her partnership anyway, and the Court held that constituted sex discrimination under Title VII of the Civil Rights Act of 1964.
The ruling established that gender stereotyping is actionable as sex discrimination.

The ruling clarified the distinction between de jure and de facto segregation, confirming that segregation was allowed if it was not considered an explicit policy of each school district. In particular, the Court held that the school systems were not responsible for desegregation across district lines unless it could be shown that they had each deliberately engaged in a policy of segregation. The case did not expand on Swann v. Charlotte-Mecklenburg Board of Education (1971), the first major Supreme Court case concerning school busing.",wiki
"Baker v. Carr, 369 U.S. 186 (1962), was a landmark United States Supreme Court case in which the Court held that redistricting qualifies as a justiciable question under the Fourteenth Amendment's equal protection clause, thus enabling federal courts to hear Fourteenth Amendment-based redistricting cases.  The court summarized its Baker holding in a later decision as follows: ""the Equal Protection Clause of the Fourteenth Amendment limits the authority of a State Legislature in designing the geographical districts from which representatives are chosen either for the State Legislature or for the Federal House of Representatives."" (Gray v. Sanders, 372 U.S. 368 (1963)). The court had previously held in Gomillion v. Lightfoot that districting claims over racial discrimination could be brought under the Fifteenth Amendment.
The case arose from a lawsuit against the state of Tennessee, which had not conducted redistricting since 1901. Tennessee argued that the composition of legislative districts constituted a nonjusticiable political question, as the U.S. Supreme Court had held in Colegrove v. Green (1946). In a majority opinion joined by five other justices, Justice William J. Brennan Jr. held that redistricting did not qualify as a political question, though he remanded the case to the federal district court for further proceedings. Justice Felix Frankfurter strongly dissented, arguing that the Court's decision cast aside history and judicial restraint and violated the separation of powers between legislatures and courts.
The case did not have any immediate effect on electoral districts, but it set an important precedent regarding the power of federal courts to address redistricting. In 1964, the Supreme Court handed down two cases, Wesberry v. Sanders and Reynolds v. Sims, that required the United States House of Representatives and state legislatures to establish electoral districts of equal population on the principle of one person, one vote.",wiki

"Radovich v. National Football League (NFL), 352 U.S. 445 (1957), is a U.S. Supreme Court decision ruling that professional football, unlike professional baseball, was subject to antitrust laws. It was the third of three such cases heard by the Court in the 1950s involving the antitrust status of professional sports.
Three justices dissented, finding the majority arbitrary and inconsistent in refusing football the exemption it had upheld five years previously in Toolson v. New York Yankees (346 U.S. 356 (1952)). The majority admitted that the similarity between the two sports from a legal standpoint would probably have denied baseball the exemption as well were it sought afresh, but existing case law had tied their hands in the absence of any congressional action.
While the NFL has secured some limited antitrust exemptions since through the legislative process, the lack of a blanket exemption due to this decision has had a major impact on the subsequent history of football. Unlike Major League Baseball, the NFL has faced several competing leagues since then (one of which merged with it) and seen five of its franchises move to new cities. Many of these actions have been accompanied by lawsuits brought against the NFL (often successfully) by competing leagues, public stadium-management authorities and its own owners.",wiki

"Whren v. United States, 517 U.S. 806 (1996), was a unanimous United States Supreme Court decision that ""declared that any traffic offense committed by a driver was a legitimate legal basis for a stop.""
In an opinion authored by Antonin Scalia, the court held that a search and seizure is not a violation of the Fourth Amendment in cases where the police officers have a ""reasonable suspicion"" that a traffic violation has occurred. The personal, or subjective, motives of an officer are not a factor in the Court's Fourth Amendment analysis of whether the cause for a stop is sufficient. The standard for reasonable suspicion is purely an objective one.
A major concern with this case's ruling is that police conducting traffic stops may racially profile the stopped persons. Similar to the controversy around New York City's Stop and Frisk program, some believe that the ruling in Whren will lead to an increase in racial profiling towards young African American males.

"Stanford v. Texas, 379 U.S. 476 (1965), is a major decision of the Supreme Court of the United States. It stated in clear terms that, pursuant to the Fourteenth Amendment, the Fourth Amendment rules regarding search and seizure applied to state governments. While this principle had been outlined in other cases, such as Mapp v. Ohio, this case added another level of constitutional consideration for the issuance of search warrants when articles of expression, protected by the First Amendment, are among the items to be taken. In effect, when a state issues a warrant that includes the order to seize books, it must accord the ""most scrupulous exactitude"" to the language of the Fourth Amendment.

"Loving v. Virginia, 388 U.S. 1 (1967), was a landmark civil rights decision of the U.S. Supreme Court that ruled that laws banning interracial marriage violate the Equal Protection and Due Process Clauses of the Fourteenth Amendment to the U.S. Constitution. Beginning in 2013, the decision was cited as precedent in U.S. federal court decisions ruling that restrictions on same-sex marriage in the United States were unconstitutional, including in the Supreme Court decision Obergefell v. Hodges (2015).
The case involved Richard Loving, a white man, and his wife Mildred Loving, a person of color. In 1959, the Lovings were sentenced to prison for violating Virginia's Racial Integrity Act of 1924, which criminalized marriage between people classified as ""white"" and people classified as ""colored"". After unsuccessfully appealing their conviction to the Supreme Court of Virginia, they appealed to the U.S. Supreme Court, arguing that the Racial Integrity Act was unconstitutional. 
In June 1967, the Supreme Court issued a unanimous decision in the Lovings' favor that overturned their convictions and struck down Virginia's Racial Integrity Act. Virginia had argued before the Court that its law was not a violation of the Equal Protection Clause because the punishment was the same regardless of the offender's race, and therefore it ""equally burdened"" both whites and non-whites. The Court found that the law nonetheless violated the Equal Protection Clause because it was based solely on ""distinctions drawn according to race"" and outlawed conduct—namely, that of getting married—that was otherwise generally accepted and that citizens were free to do. The Court's decision ended all race-based legal restrictions on marriage in the United States.",wiki

"Hoffman Estates v. The Flipside, Hoffman Estates, Inc., 455 U.S. 489 (1982), is a United States Supreme Court decision concerning the vagueness and overbreadth doctrines as they apply to restrictions on commercial speech. The justices unanimously upheld an ordinance passed by a Chicago suburb that imposed licensing requirements on the sale of drug paraphernalia by a local record store. Their decision overturned the Seventh Circuit Court of Appeals.
Concerned that the sale of items such as bongs and rolling papers, along with books and magazines devoted to the era's drug culture promoted and encouraged illegal recreational drug use, the board of trustees of the village of Hoffman Estates, Illinois, passed an ordinance requiring that vendors of drug paraphernalia obtain a license to do so, as they lacked the power to ban their sale outright. As a condition of that license, they were required to keep a record of the name and address of anyone buying such items for inspection by the police at any time. One of the two stores it applied to, The Flipside, filed suit in federal court for the Northern District of Illinois, seeking to have the ordinance invalidated, claiming its scope was so wide and overbroad as to possibly prevent the store from selling the books and magazines, thus infringing its First Amendment rights.
Justice Thurgood Marshall wrote for the Supreme Court that the village's ordinance was neither vague nor overbroad since it clearly defined the items affected and only explicitly prohibited marketing that alluded to their use in consuming illegal controlled substances. Byron White wrote a separate concurrence arguing that the Court need only have considered the vagueness issue since the Seventh Circuit had not considered the overbreadth claim. John Paul Stevens took no part in the case.
In the wake of the case many more communities began enacting and enforcing drug-paraphernalia laws, greatly curtailing their sale. It has not had much impact since then, or outside that narrow area of law, but it did establish two important precedents for later cases concerning the overbreadth and vagueness doctrines. In the former area, it clarified an earlier ruling and stated explicitly that the doctrine does not apply to commercial speech; in the latter, it established that a statute challenged for vagueness on its face, prior to enforcement, must be ""impermissibly vague in all its applications"" for the plaintiff to prevail. It also established that laws regulating economic activity, already held to a lower standard for vagueness since businesspeople can reasonably be expected to know their industry and its products, have an even lower standard to meet when they only call for civil penalties.",wiki

"Regents of the University of California v. Bakke, 438 U.S. 265 (1978), was a landmark decision by the Supreme Court of the United States that involved a dispute of whether preferential treatment for minorities could reduce educational opportunities for whites without violating the Constitution. It upheld affirmative action, allowing race to be one of several factors in college admission policy. However, the court ruled that specific racial quotas, such as the 16 out of 100 seats set aside for minority students by the University of California, Davis, School of Medicine, were impermissible.
Although the Supreme Court had outlawed segregation in schools by the Brown v. Board of Education decision and had ordered school districts to take steps to assure integration, the question of the legality of voluntary affirmative action programs initiated by universities remained unresolved.  Proponents deemed such programs necessary to make up for past discrimination, while opponents believed they were illegal and a violation of the Equal Protection Clause of the Fourteenth Amendment to the U.S. Constitution. An earlier case that the Supreme Court had taken in an attempt to address the issue, DeFunis v. Odegaard (1974), was dismissed on procedural grounds.
Allan P. Bakke (), an engineer and former Marine officer, sought admission to medical school but was rejected for admission partly because of his age — Bakke was in his early 30s while applying, which at least two institutions considered too old. After twice being rejected by the University of California, Davis, he brought suit in state court challenging the constitutionality of the school's affirmative-action program. The California Supreme Court struck down the program as violative of the rights of white applicants and ordered Bakke admitted.  The U.S. Supreme Court accepted the case amid wide public attention.
The ruling on the case was highly fractured. The nine justices issued a total of six opinions. The judgment of the court was written by Justice Lewis F. Powell Jr.; two different blocs of four justices joined various parts of Powell's opinion.  Finding diversity in the classroom to be a compelling state interest, Powell opined that affirmative action in general was allowed under the Constitution and the Title VI of the Civil Rights Act of 1964.  Nevertheless, UC Davis's program went too far for a majority of justices; it was struck down and Bakke was admitted. The practical effect of Bakke was that most affirmative action programs continued without change. Questions about whether the Bakke case was merely a plurality opinion or binding precedent were addressed in 2003 when the court upheld Powell's position in the majority opinion of Grutter v. Bollinger. However, in 2023, the Supreme Court reversed that position, finding that affirmative action in student admissions impermissibly violated the Equal Protection Clause of the Fourteenth Amendment in Students for Fair Admissions v. Harvard and Students for Fair Admissions v. University of North Carolina.

"United States v. Williams, 504 U.S. 36 (1992), was a U.S. Supreme Court case concerning the presentation of exculpatory evidence to a grand jury. It ruled that the federal courts do not have the supervisory power to require prosecutors to present exculpatory evidence to the grand jury. The opinion was written by Justice Scalia, and the dissent by Justice Stevens.
The question addressed by the court was whether a district court may properly dismiss an indictment when the prosecutor withheld ""substantial exculpatory evidence"" that could lead the grand jury to reject the indictment but does not necessarily rise to the level of prosecutorial misconduct, which would require the dismissal of an indictment. The significance of the ruling lies not only in its definition of the duty of the prosecutor in regard to presenting exculpatory evidence before the grand jury but also in its definition of the grand jury's accusatory role.
The ruling protects prosecutors who withhold ""substantial exculpatory evidence"" to obtain an indictment, as the role of the grand jury is not to determine guilt but to decide whether there is enough evidence of a crime; exculpatory evidence can be presented at trial. Justice Stevens's dissent focused on the argument that a prosecutor's failure to present substantially-exculpatory evidence is a form of prosecutorial misconduct, but that nevertheless, the prosecutor need not ""ferret out and present all evidence that could be used at trial to create a reasonable doubt as to defendant's guilt.""",wiki

"Summers v. Earth Island Institute, 555 U.S. 488 (2009), was a United States Supreme Court case decided 5–4 in which several environmental organizations, including Earth Island Institute, brought suit against the United States Forest Service (USFS) to enjoin that federal agency from implementing rules that would allow the salvage sale of timber from 238 acres of fire-damaged federally owned land without conducting the notice, comment, and appeal process of the Forest Service Decision-making and Appeals Reform Act.
While the environmental organizations were litigating the injunction in the lower courts, the parties reached a settlement regarding the 238 acres in question and the district court accordingly dismissed. The plaintiffs, however, maintained that they still had standing to challenge the constitutionality of the exemption process generally because the process was statistically certain to implicate their rights in the future.  The Court decided that this argument failed because, after voluntarily settling the portion of their lawsuit relevant to Burnt Ridge, respondents and their members are no longer under threat of injury from that project.  The Court decided against the plaintiffs, holding that the ""deprivation of a procedural right without some concrete interest that is affected by the deprivation . . . is insufficient to create Article III standing.""",wiki

"Witherspoon v. Illinois, 391 U.S. 510 (1968), was a U.S. Supreme Court case where the court ruled that a state statute providing the state unlimited challenge for cause of jurors who might have any objection to the death penalty gave too much bias in favor of the prosecution.
The Court said,

Whatever else might be said of capital punishment, it is at least clear that its imposition by a hanging jury cannot be squared with the Constitution. The State of Illinois has stacked the deck against the petitioner. To execute this death sentence would deprive him of his life without due process of law.
The decision in this case would cause the Supreme Court of California to order a retrial on the penalty phase in the 1972 case of California v. Anderson, and when the case was heard for the third time, would find the imposition of the death penalty was unconstitutional on the grounds of the penalty being cruel or unusual punishment, in violation of the State Constitution.  The decision would become national in scale when the U.S. Supreme Court also in 1972 ruled in Furman v. Georgia that all death penalty cases were in violation of the 8th Amendment's prohibition on cruel and unusual punishment.",wiki

"Wesberry v. Sanders, 376 U.S. 1 (1964), was a landmark U.S. Supreme Court case in which the Court ruled that districts in the United States House of Representatives must be approximately equal in population. Along with Baker v. Carr (1962) and Reynolds v. Sims (1964), it was part of a series of Warren Court cases that applied the principle of ""one person, one vote"" to U.S. legislative bodies.
Article One of the United States Constitution requires members of the U.S. House of Representatives to be apportioned by population among the states, but it does not specify exactly how the representatives from each state should be elected. The case arose from a challenge to the unequal population of congressional districts in the state of Georgia.
In his majority opinion, which was joined by five other justices, Associate Justice Hugo Black held that Article One required that ""as nearly as practicable one man's vote in a congressional election is to be worth as much as another's."" The decision had a major impact on representation in the House, as many states had districts of unequal population, often to the detriment of urban voters. The United States Senate was unaffected by the decision since the Constitution explicitly grants each state two senators representing the state at large.",wiki
"Hampton v. United States, 425 U.S. 484 (1976), is a United States Supreme Court decision on the subject of Entrapment. By a 5–3 margin, the Court upheld the conviction of a Missouri man for selling heroin even though all the drug sold was supplied to him, he claimed, by a Drug Enforcement Administration informant who had, in turn, gotten it from the DEA. The majority held that the record showed Hampton was predisposed to sell drugs no matter his source.
The case came before the court when the defendant argued that while he was predisposed, it was irrelevant since the government's possible role as sole supplier in the case constituted the sort of ""outrageous government conduct"" that Justice William Rehnquist had speculated could lead to the reversal of a conviction in the court's last entrapment case, United States v. Russell. Rehnquist was not impressed and rejected the argument in his majority opinion.
The dissents agreed that the government's purported action was outrageous and that the conviction should be overturned on those grounds. The justices were among those who had said in Russell that the ""subjective"" entrapment standard adopted by the Court since it first recognized entrapment as a valid defense in Sorrells v. United States, was less fair and appropriate than the ""objective"" standard of evaluating official conduct, which dissents and concurrences in entrapment cases over the years had argued for. However, this was the last entrapment case to feature that conflict.

"Furman v. Georgia, 408 U.S. 238 (1972), was a landmark criminal case in which the United States Supreme Court decided that arbitrary and inconsistent imposition of the death penalty violates the Eighth and Fourteenth Amendments, and constitutes cruel and unusual punishment. It was a per curiam decision. Five justices each wrote separately in support of the decision.: 467–68  Although the justices did not rule that the death penalty was unconstitutional, the Furman decision invalidated the death sentences of nearly 700 people. The decision mandated a degree of consistency in the application of the death penalty. This case resulted in a de facto moratorium of capital punishment throughout the United States. Dozens of states rewrote their death penalty laws, most of which were upheld in the 1976 case Gregg v. Georgia.
The Supreme Court consolidated the cases Jackson v. Georgia and Branch v. Texas with the Furman decision, thereby invalidating the death penalty for rape; this ruling was confirmed post-Gregg in Coker v. Georgia. The Court had also intended to include the case of Aikens v. California, but between the time Aikens had been heard in oral argument and a decision was to be issued, the Supreme Court of California decided in California v. Anderson that the death penalty violated the state constitution; Aikens was therefore dismissed as moot, since this decision reduced all death sentences in California to life imprisonment.

"Kawakita v. United States, 343 U.S. 717 (1952), is a United States Supreme Court case in which the Court ruled that a dual U.S./Japanese citizen could be convicted of treason against the United States for acts performed in Japan during World War II. Tomoya Kawakita, born in California to Japanese parents, was in Japan when the war broke out and stayed in Japan until the war was over. After returning to the United States, he was arrested and charged with treason for having abused American prisoners of war. Kawakita claimed he could not be found guilty of treason since he had lost his U.S. citizenship while in Japan, but this argument was rejected by the courts (including the Supreme Court), which ruled that he had in fact retained his U.S. citizenship during the war. Originally sentenced to death, Kawakita's sentence was commuted to life imprisonment, and he was eventually released from prison, deported to Japan, and barred from ever returning to the United States.
Kawakita is currently one of the last people to be convicted of treason in the United States. One other person, John David Provoo, was convicted of treason in 1952. However, Provoo's conviction was overturned on appeal. The distinction currently goes to Herbert John Burgman, who was convicted of treason in 1949.",wiki

"Terry v. Ohio, 392 U.S. 1 (1968), was a landmark U.S. Supreme Court decision in which the court ruled that it is constitutional for American police to ""stop and frisk"" a person they reasonably suspect to be armed and involved in a crime. Specifically, the decision held that a police officer does not violate the Fourth Amendment to the U.S. Constitution's prohibition on unreasonable searches and seizures when questioning someone even though the officer lacks probable cause to arrest the person, so long as the police officer has a reasonable suspicion that the person has committed, is committing, or is about to commit a crime. The court also ruled that the police officer may perform a quick surface search of the person's outer clothing for weapons if they have reasonable suspicion that the person stopped is ""armed and presently dangerous."" This reasonable suspicion must be based on ""specific and articulable facts,"" and not merely upon an officer's hunch.
This permitted police action has subsequently been referred to in short as a ""stop and frisk"", ""stop, question, and frisk,"" or simply a ""Terry stop."" The Terry standard was later extended to temporary detentions of persons in vehicles, known as traffic stops; see Terry stop for a summary of subsequent jurisprudence. The rationale behind the Supreme Court decision revolves around the notion that, as the opinion argues, ""the exclusionary rule has its limitations."" According to the court, the meaning of the rule is to protect persons from unreasonable searches and seizures aimed at gathering evidence, not searches and seizures for other purposes (like prevention of crime or personal protection of police officers).
Legal scholars have criticized this ruling stating that ""the people's constitutional right against the use of abusive police power"" has been sacrificed in favor of a ""police-purported need for a workable tool short of probable cause to use in temporary investigatory detentions."" Critics also state that it has led to negative legislative outcomes and permitting instances of racial profiling.

"Sherbert v. Verner, 374 U.S. 398 (1963), was a case in which the Supreme Court of the United States held that the Free Exercise Clause of the First Amendment required the government to demonstrate both a compelling interest and that the law in question was narrowly tailored before it denied unemployment compensation to someone who was fired because her job requirements substantially conflicted with her religion.
The case established the Sherbert Test, requiring demonstration of such a compelling interest and narrow tailoring in all Free Exercise cases in which a religious person was substantially burdened by a law. The conditions are the key components of what is usually called strict scrutiny. This means that if someone's religious beliefs faced a serious burden due to a law and the government had no reasonable alternatives for that law, the government would have the burden to prove that the law was justified. The Sherbert test has received praise by legal scholars at the time and thereafter.
In 1990, the Supreme Court decided that the Sherbert Test, as a judicial constitutional analysis tool, was too broad when applied to all laws. With respect to religiously neutral, generally applicable laws that incidentally burden religious exercise, the Sherbert Test was eliminated in Employment Division v. Smith. For laws that discriminate along religious/secular lines or neutral laws that are enforced in a discriminatory way, the components of the Sherbert Test are still appropriate constitutional tools for courts to use.
In response to the 1990 Smith decision, Congress created an enhanced version of the Sherbert Test as a statutory, rather than constitutional, right in the federal Religious Freedom Restoration Act (RFRA) of 1993. Its provisions were designed to apply broadly to all laws and regulations, both federal and state. Although Congress replaced the ""narrowly tailored"" constitutional requirement with a ""least restrictive means"" statutory requirement, the enhanced test is still referred to as the Sherbert Test.
However, the Supreme Court held in City of Boerne v. Flores that the law was unconstitutional because its enhanced Sherbert Test, as a purported change in constitutional rights, could not be enforced against the states.  It impermissibly interfered with the judiciary's sole power to interpret the Constitution. However, the ruling did not necessarily limit its effect on interpretation of federal statutes.
In 2000, Congress passed the Religious Land Use and Institutionalized Persons Act (RLUIPA) that applied only to federal laws.  Both laws contain the same language for an even further enhanced Sherbert Test, one that broadens the definition of substantial religious burden.
The Supreme Court has since relied on the statutory Sherbert Test to decide several prominent cases, including Burwell v. Hobby Lobby, 573 U.S. 682 (2014), and Gonzales v. O Centro Espírita Beneficente União do Vegetal, 546 U.S. 418 (2006).

"Turner Broadcasting System, Inc. v.

In the first ruling, known colloquially as Turner I, 512 U.S. 622 (1994), the Supreme Court held that cable television companies were First Amendment speakers who enjoyed free speech rights when determining what channels and content to carry on their networks, but demurred on whether the must-carry rules at issue were restrictions of those rights. After a remand to a lower court for fact-finding on the economic effects of the then-recent Cable Television Consumer Protection and Competition Act, the dispute returned to the Supreme Court. In Turner II, 520 U.S. 180 (1997), the Supreme Court held that must-carry rules for cable television companies were not restrictions of their free speech rights because the U.S. government had a compelling interest in enabling the distribution of media content from multiple sources and in preserving local television.

"Meyer v. Grant, 486 U.S. 414 (1988), was an important decision by the United States Supreme Court on paid petition circulation. Colorado was one of several states with a process for citizens to propose initiatives for the ballot, which if passed became law. One of the requirements was to get the signatures of a significant number of registered Colorado electors. Colorado prohibited initiative sponsors from paying for the circulation of these petitions. The state argued this was necessary to ""protect[...] the integrity of the initiative.""
In 1984, Coloradans for Free Enterprise, an interest group, proposed an initiative to deregulate the motor industry by removing it from the jurisdiction of the Public Utilities Commission. After the title and summary were approved by the state, they began unpaid circulation. They eventually concluded that they would not be able to get the 46,737 required signatures by the deadline. They then filed suit under 42 U.S.C. 1983 against the Secretary of State of Colorado, Natalie Meyer, and the Attorney General of Colorado, Duane Woodard, in their official capacities. The plaintiffs alleged that the Colorado statute infringed on their First Amendment rights. The district court, with Judge John P. Moore sitting, declined to overturn the law, finding that ""the evidence did not indicate that plaintiffs were prevented in any way from espousing their cause simply because they could not obtain paid petition circulators.""

The court granted a rehearing en banc at the plaintiff's request, and vacated the panel's opinion.

"Nevada Commission on Ethics v. Carrigan, 564 U.S. 117 (2011), was a Supreme Court of the United States decision in which the Court held that the Nevada Ethics in Government Law, which required government officials recuse in cases involving a conflict of interest, is not unconstitutionally overbroad. Specifically, the law requires government officials to recuse themselves from advocating for and voting on the passage of legislation if private commitments to the interests of others materially affect the official's judgment. Under the terms of this law, the Nevada Commission on Ethics censured city councilman Michael Carrigan for voting on a land project for which his campaign manager was a paid consultant. Carrigan challenged his censure in court and the Nevada Supreme Court ruled in his favor, claiming that casting his vote was protected speech.

"Pacific Gas & Electric v. Public Utilities Commission, 475 U.S. 1 (1986), was a United States Supreme Court case involving a dispute over newsletters that the San Francisco–based privately-owned public utility Pacific Gas and Electric Company (PG&E) had included with its monthly bills to customers. The special interest group Toward Utility Rate Normalization (TURN) sued PG&E, arguing that the extra space in the billing envelope taken by the newsletters constituted a form of political speech whose cost the public should not have to bear.
The California Public Utilities Commission mediated the dispute and initially determined that, since the space in the envelope ostensibly belonged to the general public, PG&E could be compelled to carry a message supplied by TURN in rebuttal to the messages supplied in the newsletter. The rationale used by the regulatory agency was that the space in the billing envelope which could have material added that did not increase postage belonged to the ratepayers rather than the utility; thus the commission could order the utility to allow other groups to use that space subject to restrictions. 
PG&E responded to the decision by suing California's Public Utilities Commission, invoking a First Amendment right against compelled speech. Among other arguments, PG&E contended that it should not be compelled to carry messages it disagrees with, that the inclusion only of critical viewpoints was discriminatory, and that it was being compelled to formulate and include a rebuttal to TURN's comments with each mailing.
The U.S. Supreme Court found the order of the California Public Utilities Commission to be unconstitutional, as the right to speak includes the right not to carry messages one disagrees with. As the court stated, ""the choice to speak includes within it the choice of what not to say."" The case became an important precedent for cases involving the free speech rights of private corporations. It also critically granted, with very limited exceptions, the absolute right of a publisher to choose not to carry messages it does not agree with.",wiki

During a single trip, officers followed a car containing the beeper, relying on beeper signal to determine the car's final destination. The Court unanimously held that since the use of such a device did not violate a legitimate expectation of privacy there was no search and seizure and thus the use was allowed without a warrant. It reasoned that a person traveling in public has no expectation of privacy in one's movements. Since there was no search and seizure there was not a Fourth Amendment violation.",wiki

"C&A Carbone, Inc. v. Town of Clarkstown, New York, 511 U.S. 383 (1994), was a case before the United States Supreme Court in which the plaintiff, a private recycler with business in Clarkstown, New York, sought to ship its non-recyclable waste to cheaper waste processors out-of-state. Clarkstown opposed the move, and the company then brought suit, raising the unconstitutionality of Clarkstown's ""flow control ordinance,"" which required solid wastes that were not recyclable or hazardous to be deposited at a particular private company's transfer facility. The ordinance involved fees that were above market rates. The Supreme Court sided with the plaintiff, concluding that Clarkstown's ordinance violated the Dormant Commerce Clause.
Furthermore, the Supreme Court held, ""Discrimination against interstate commerce in favor of local business or investment is per se invalid,"" with a very narrow exception where the city can show, under rigorous scrutiny, that there are no other means to advance a legitimate local interest. In the case at hand, the city could have subsidized the waste disposal plant, which was at least one alternative to the discriminatory law that the city tried to use.
Justice Anthony Kennedy delivered the opinion of the Court.
It was held that the ordinance: (1) regulated interstate commerce, because (a) the company's recycling center processed waste from places other than the town, including from out of state, and (b) the ordinance: (i) drove up the cost for out-of-state interests to dispose of their solid waste, and 			(ii) deprived out-of-state businesses of access to a local market; and (2) violated the commerce clause by depriving competitors, including out-of-state firms, of access to a local market, because: (a) the ordinance: (i) discriminated by allowing only the favored operator to process waste within the town, (ii) hoarded solid waste, and the demand to get rid of it, for the benefit of the preferred processing facility, and (iii) squelched competition in waste-processing service, and (b) the town: (i) had nondiscriminatory alternatives, such as uniform safety regulations enacted without the object to discriminate, for addressing the health and environmental problems alleged to justify the ordinance, (ii) could not justify the ordinance as a way to steer solid waste away from out-of-town disposal sites that the town might deem harmful to the environment, where to do so would extend the town's police power beyond its jurisdictional bounds, and (iii) could subsidize the facility through general taxes or municipal bonds.
Justice Sandra Day O'Connor, in an opinion concurring with the judgment of the Court, agreed with the majority that the ordinance violated the commerce clause, but rejected the view that the ordinance discriminated against interstate commerce. Instead, she believed that the ordinance was unconstitutional since it imposed an excessive burden on interstate commerce.",wiki

"Griswold v. Connecticut, 381 U.S. 479 (1965), was a landmark decision of the U.S. Supreme Court in which the Court ruled that the Constitution of the United States protects the liberty of married couples to use contraceptives without government restriction. The case involved a Connecticut ""Little Comstock Act"" that prohibited any person from using ""any drug, medicinal article or instrument for the purpose of preventing conception"". The court held that the statute was unconstitutional, and that its effect was ""to deny disadvantaged citizens ... access to medical assistance and up-to-date information in respect to proper methods of birth control."" By a vote of 7–2, the Supreme Court invalidated the law on the grounds that it violated the ""right to marital privacy"", establishing the basis for the right to privacy with respect to intimate practices. This and other cases view the right to privacy as ""protected from governmental intrusion"".
Although the U.S. Bill of Rights does not explicitly mention ""privacy"", Justice William O. Douglas wrote for the majority, ""Would we allow the police to search the sacred precincts of marital bedrooms for telltale signs of the use of contraceptives? The very idea is repulsive to the notions of privacy surrounding the marriage relationship."" Justice Arthur Goldberg wrote a concurring opinion in which he used the Ninth Amendment to the U.S. Constitution in support of the ruling. Justice John Marshall Harlan II wrote a concurring opinion arguing that privacy is protected by the due process clause of the Fourteenth Amendment to the U.S. Constitution, while Justice Byron White argued that Connecticut's law failed the rational basis standard.

"AT&T Mobility LLC v. Concepcion, 563 U.S. 333 (2011), is a legal dispute that was decided by the United States Supreme Court. On April 27, 2011, the Court ruled, by a 5–4 margin, that the Federal Arbitration Act of 1925 preempts state laws that prohibit contracts from disallowing class-wide arbitration, such as the law previously upheld by the California Supreme Court in the case of Discover Bank v. Superior Court. As a result, businesses that include arbitration agreements with class action waivers can require consumers to bring claims only in individual arbitrations, rather than in court as part of a class action.: 708–09 
The decision was described by Jean Sternlight as a ""tsunami that is wiping out existing and potential consumer and employment class actions"": 704  and by law professor Myriam Gilles as ""the real game-changer for class action litigation"". By April 2012, Concepcion was cited in at least 76 decisions sending putative class actions to individual arbitration.

The magazine Consumer Reports had published in 1970 a review of an unusual loudspeaker system manufactured by Bose Corporation, called the Bose 901. The review expressed skepticism of the system's quality and recommended that consumers delay purchase until they had investigated for themselves whether the loudspeaker system's unusual attributes would suit them. Bose objected to numerous statements in the article, including the sentences, ""Worse, individual instruments heard through the Bose system seemed to grow to gigantic proportions and tended to wander about the room. For instance, a violin appeared to be 10 feet (3.0 m) wide and a piano stretched from wall to wall.""

Despite the statement, the Chancery Court never elaborated on the evidence or clearly explained why M.L.B.'s parental rights had been dismissed. When M.L.B. went to appeal, she was unable to pay for the record preparation fees of $2,352.36 and so was denied. She then went to appeal under in forma pauperis but was again denied on the grounds that in forma pauperis is not demanded in civil cases, only criminal cases.
The case was then brought to the Supreme Court, where M.L.B. held that an inability to pay court fees should not be decisive of something as precious as parental rights. She used the guidelines set out in the due process and equal protection clauses of the Fourteenth Amendment to fight her case.
The Supreme Court decided in the petitioner's favor and stated that in matters regarding parental rights, a court may not stop a party from appealing the case based on financial means.
Because this ruling extended in forma pauperis to civil cases, there was a question of how liberally it could be applied. It was then clarified that in forma pauperis may be applied to civil cases only if state controls or intrusions on family relationships are involved. The Supreme Court decided that the family unit is considered so fundamental that its liberty interests should be protected by the Fourteenth Amendment. The protection of appellate rights was considered to be just as important as that of criminal rights.",wiki

"United States v. International Boxing Club of New York, 348 U.S. 236 (1955), often referred to as International Boxing Club or just International Boxing, was an antitrust decision of the U.S. Supreme Court. By a 7–2 margin, the justices ruled that the exemption it had previously upheld for Major League Baseball was peculiar and unique to that sport and that it did not apply to boxing. Since it met the definition of interstate commerce, the government could therefore proceed with a trial to prove IBCNY and the other defendants had conspired to monopolize the market for championship boxing in the United States.
It was the first time another sport had argued it was covered by the same exemption as baseball by virtue of being a professional sport. Chief Justice Earl Warren, writing for the majority, admitted that it would never have reached the Court but for the baseball exemption, and dissenting justices Felix Frankfurter and Sherman Minton were unsparing in their criticism of the arbitrary nature of this distinction.
The case was remanded for trial, which the government won, forcing the breakup of some of the defendant companies.

Respondents challenged the constitutionality of N.Y. Civil Service Law § 53, which denied all aliens the right to hold positions in New York's classified competitive civil service. Respondents sought a declaration that the statute was invalid under U.S. Constitution amendments I and XIV, injunctive relief, and damages for lost earnings.
The Court affirmed the lower court's decision and determined that aliens as a class were a prime example of a discrete and insular minority.

The case examined whether tobacco companies could be liable for not warning the consumer ""adequately"" of the dangers of  cigarettes as well as ultimately held the stance that smoking was in fact a free choice. The ruling also questioned the Cigarette Labeling and Advertising Act of 1965 to determine whether the warning labels on the cigarette products by law had to be less or more alarming than the warning issued.

"Colautti v. Franklin, 439 U.S. 379 (1979), was a United States Supreme Court abortion rights case, which held void for vagueness part of Pennsylvania's 1974 Abortion Control Act. The section in question was the following:

(a) Every person who performs or induces an abortion shall prior thereto have made a determination based on his experience, judgment or professional competence that the fetus is not viable, and if the determination is that the fetus is viable or if there is sufficient reason to believe that the fetus may be viable, shall exercise that degree of professional skill, care and diligence to preserve the life and health of the fetus which such person would be required to exercise in order to preserve the life and health of any fetus intended to be born and not aborted and the abortion technique employed shall be that which would provide the best opportunity for the fetus to be aborted alive so long as a different technique would not be necessary in order to preserve the life or health of the mother.

Doctors who failed to adhere to the provisions of this section were liable to civil and criminal prosecution ""as would pertain to him had the fetus been a child who was intended to be born and not aborted."" Franklin and others sued, arguing that the provision was both vague and overbroad. In a 6–3 decision written by Roe author Harry Blackmun, the Supreme Court agreed, finding that requiring a determination ""if... the fetus is viable or if there is sufficient reason to believe the fetus may be viable"" was insufficient and impermissibly vague guidance for physicians who might face criminal liability if a jury disagrees with their judgment.",wiki

"Mt. Healthy City School District Board of Education v. Doyle, 429 U.S. 274 (1977), often shortened to Mt. Healthy v. Doyle, was a unanimous U.S. Supreme Court decision arising from a fired teacher's lawsuit against his former employer, the Mount Healthy City Schools. The Court considered three issues: whether federal-question jurisdiction existed in the case, whether the Eleventh Amendment barred federal lawsuits against school districts, and whether the First and Fourteenth Amendments prevented the district, as a government agency, from firing or otherwise disciplining an employee for constitutionally protected speech on a matter of public concern where the same action might have taken place for other, unprotected activities. Justice William Rehnquist wrote the opinion.
The case was first heard in the Southern District of Ohio. In 1971, Fred Doyle, who had been teaching social studies for five years in the Mount Healthy City Schools, learned his contract had not been renewed, not only denying him tenure but any further employment with the district. The superintendent's letter cited both an incident where he had made an obscene gesture to students and his sharing of a district dress code for teachers with a local radio station as displaying a ""lack of tact"". He took a position with another district and filed suit under Section 1983, arguing his constitutional rights to free speech had been violated, per the Court's 1967 decision in Pickering v. Board of Education, another case involving an untenured teacher fired for speaking out in the media. After the district court ruled in his favor, the school district appealed to the Sixth Circuit Court of Appeals, which partially vacated the decision in a brief per curiam opinion late in 1975.
The Supreme Court took the case and heard oral argument almost a year later. It handed down its decision early in 1977. On the jurisdictional question, Rehnquist held that although the school district had been created by state law, it was primarily a local entity and thus beyond the reach of the Eleventh Amendment, its first ruling in that area in 86 years. The Court did not, however, decide the question of whether Doyle had been fired legally, since there were other incidents suggesting he had difficulties in his relationships with students and fellow teachers which the district had introduced into the record. Instead, it remanded the case to the district court, ordering it to require the district to show by a preponderance of evidence that Doyle would have been fired regardless if he had not contacted the radio station. The school district was later able to do so, and in 1982 the Sixth Circuit upheld that decision.
The case introduced what has since become known as the ""Mt. Healthy test"" into similar cases that follow the Pickering line in asserting the First Amendment rights of public employees where the employer claims other, unprotected conduct motivated the adverse action, a two-prong process that shifts the burden of proof from plaintiff to defendant in the course of the action. First, the plaintiff must prove that the activity they were allegedly disciplined for was indeed protected speech. The defendant must then show by a preponderance that the adverse action would have occurred if the protected activity had never happened. This has been criticized as allowing public employers a way to circumvent restrictions on taking adverse action against whistleblowers, and more generally as incompatible with the underlying principles of tort law. The test has also been expanded into mixed motive discrimination cases in employment law.",wiki

Natural Resources Defense Council, Inc., 467 U.S. 837 (1984), was a landmark decision of the United States Supreme Court that set forth the legal test used when U.S. federal courts must defer to a government agency's interpretation of a law or statute. The decision articulated a doctrine known as ""Chevron deference"". Chevron deference consisted of a two-part test that was deferential to government agencies: first, whether Congress has spoken directly to the precise issue at question, and second, ""whether the agency's answer is based on a permissible construction of the statute"".
The decision involved a legal challenge to a change in the U.S. government's interpretation of the word ""source"" in the Clean Air Act of 1963. The Act did not precisely define what constituted a ""source"" of air pollution. The Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) initially defined ""source"" to cover essentially any significant change or addition to a plant or factory. In 1981, the EPA changed its definition to mean only an entire plant or factory. This allowed companies to build new projects without going through the EPA's lengthy new review process if they simultaneously modified other parts of their plant to reduce emissions, avoiding any net change. Natural Resources Defense Council, an environmentalist advocacy group, challenged the legality of the EPA's new definition. NRDC won the case in a federal court, but the Supreme Court overturned that decision and ruled in favor of Chevron on the grounds that the courts should broadly defer to EPA and other independent regulatory agencies.
Chevron was one of the most important decisions in U.S. administrative law and was cited in thousands of cases. Forty years later, in June 2024, the Supreme Court overruled Chevron in Loper Bright Enterprises v. Raimondo, on the ground that it conflicts with the Administrative Procedure Act.",wiki

"Ransom v. FIA Card Services, N. A., 562 U.S. 61 (2011), is a decision by the Supreme Court of the United States involving the means test in Chapter 13 of the United States Bankruptcy Code.  The means test had been adopted by the Bankruptcy Abuse Prevention and Consumer Protection Act of 2005, and Ransom is one of several cases in which the Supreme Court addressed provisions of that act.
The means test determines how much disposable income debtors have to pay back their creditors, and permits debtors to shield some income from creditors for expenses based on cost tables prepared by the Internal Revenue Service.  The Court ruled in Ransom, primarily in reliance on supplemental commentary authored by the IRS, that a car-ownership cost allowance was available only to debtors who made loan or lease payments on a vehicle.  This judgment resolved a circuit split regarding the allowance between the Ninth Circuit, which the Supreme Court affirmed in this case, and three other circuits that had all ruled the allowance applied even to debtors who owned their cars outright.
The Court's opinion was delivered by Justice Elena Kagan, who was confirmed to the Court on August 7, 2010.  The opinion was not only her first as a Supreme Court justice but also as a judge, and her participation in the case's oral argument, which was held on the first day of the Court's 2010 term, had also been her first.

"Moses H. Cone Memorial Hospital v. Mercury Construction Corp., 460 U.S. 1 (1983), commonly cited as Moses Cone or Cone Hospital, is a United States Supreme Court decision concerning civil procedure, specifically the abstention doctrine, as it applies to enforcing an arbitration clause in a diversity case. By a 6–3 margin, the justices resolved a complicated construction dispute by ruling that a North Carolina hospital had to arbitrate a claim against the Alabama-based company it had hired to build a new wing, even though it meant that it could not consolidate it with ongoing litigation it had brought in state court against the contractor and architect.
Justice William Brennan wrote for the majority that a district court's stay of the contractor's petition to compel arbitration was an ""abuse of discretion"". It had not properly applied the Court's prior ruling in Colorado River Water Conservation District v. United States. Since the net effect of the stay was to force the contractor to litigate in state court, Mercury's appeal to the Fourth Circuit was proper, and the appeals court properly reversed the stay. Since the contract was covered by the Federal Arbitration Act (FAA), the hospital had no way to avoid arbitration, which the contractor could not be assured of getting under existing state law.
William Rehnquist's dissent, joined by Chief Justice Warren E. Burger and Sandra Day O'Connor, accused the majority of misreading the case in order to get the contractor into arbitration. He argued that another case, Will v. Calvert Fire Insurance Co., permitted the district court's action, which in any case was routine docket management practiced by many district judges.
While arbitration was not the main issue in the case, it had a profound effect on future cases concerning the FAA. Two of Brennan's passing dicta, that the FAA applied to actions in state court and that it enacted a national policy in favor of arbitration, became the central holdings of Southland Corp. v. Keating the following year, a case from which O'Connor and Rehnquist dissented. Those holdings have been challenged, even by some other justices, as fundamentally at odds with the language and legislative history of the FAA, even as the Court has continued to expand its scope since then.",wiki

"Stanley v. Georgia, 394 U.S. 557 (1969), was a landmark decision of the Supreme Court of the United States that helped to establish an implied ""right to privacy"" in U.S. law in the form of mere possession of obscene materials.
The home of Robert Eli Stanley, a suspected bookmaker, was searched by police with a federal warrant to seize betting paraphernalia. As they found none, they instead seized three reels of pornographic material from a desk drawer in an upstairs bedroom, and later charged Stanley with the possession of obscene materials, a crime under Georgia law. The conviction was upheld by the Supreme Court of Georgia.
In the Supreme Court of the United States, Justice Thurgood Marshall wrote the unanimous opinion that overturned the earlier decision and invalidated all state laws that forbade the private possession of materials judged obscene on the grounds of the First and Fourteenth amendments to the United States Constitution.  Justices Potter Stewart, William J. Brennan, and Byron White contributed a joint concurring opinion with a separate opinion having to do with the Fourth Amendment search and seizure provision.

"Trop v. Dulles, 356 U.S. 86 (1958), was a United States Supreme Court case in which the Court ruled that it was unconstitutional to revoke citizenship as a punishment for a crime. The ruling's reference to ""evolving standards of decency"" is frequently cited in Eighth Amendment jurisprudence.
Albert Trop was a natural born citizen of the United States who, while serving as a private in the United States Army in 1944, escaped from an Army stockade in Casablanca, Morocco. The next day, he willingly surrendered to an army officer and was taken back to the base, where he was subsequently court-martialed, convicted of desertion, and sentenced to three years at hard labor, forfeiture of pay, and a dishonorable discharge.
In 1952, Trop applied for a US passport, which was denied because §401(g) of the Nationality Act of 1940 provided that members of the armed forces of the United States who were convicted and dishonorably discharged for wartime desertion would lose their citizenship.
Trop filed suit in US federal courts seeking declaratory judgment that he was a US citizen.

"Graham v. John Deere Co., 383 U.S. 1 (1966), was a case in which the United States Supreme Court clarified the nonobviousness requirement in United States patent law, set forth 14 years earlier in Patent Act of 1952 and codified as  35 U.S.C. § 103.
Although the Court confirmed that non-obviousness is a question of law, it held that §103 required a determination of the following questions of fact to resolve the issue of obviousness:

Scope and content of the prior art
Differences between the claimed invention and the prior art
Level of ordinary skill in the art
In addition, the Court mentioned ""secondary considerations"" which could serve as evidence of nonobviousness. These are known as ""Graham's factors"":

Commercial success
Long felt but unsolved needs
Failure of others
Unexpected results
The Court stated, that the purpose of these factors is to ""guard against slipping into use of hindsight"" when making a determination of obviousness.
The SCOTUS also proposed the inducement standard, suggesting that patent law's nonobviousness doctrine is meant to restrict the award of patents to only ""those inventions which would not be disclosed or devised but for the inducement of a patent."" Although, the Graham's factors have been cited numerous times by patent examiners and courts, the inducement standard has been largely ignored.
Despite providing these useful guidelines, the Court also recognized that these questions would likely need to be answered on a case-by-case basis, first by the United States Patent and Trademark Office (USPTO), then by the courts. The ""non-obviousness criteria"" laid out in Graham were complemented in 2007 by ""obviousness criteria"" in another US Supreme Court case (see KSR v. Teleflex).

In the majority opinion, Justice Harry Blackmun rejected the idea that the installation and use of a pen register constitutes a violation of the suspect's reasonable expectation of privacy since the telephone numbers would be available to and recorded by the phone company anyway.
The Smith ruling was the Supreme Court's first significant articulation of the third-party doctrine in which government investigators may be permitted to search a person's private information by obtaining it not from the person directly, but from a business or other party with which the person has traded such information voluntarily.",wiki
"McIntyre v. Ohio Elections Commission, 514 U.S. 334 (1995), is a case in which the Supreme Court of the United States held that an Ohio statute prohibiting anonymous campaign literature is unconstitutional because it violates the First Amendment to the U.S. Constitution, which protects the freedom of speech. In a 7–2 decision authored by Justice John Paul Stevens, the Court found that the First Amendment protects the decision of an author to remain anonymous.
On April 27, 1988, Margaret McIntyre stood outside of a middle school in Westerville, Ohio, and passed out anonymous leaflets that opposed a proposed school district tax levy. The Ohio Elections Commission fined McIntyre $100 for violating a state law that prohibited the distribution of any kind of political or campaign literature that does not have the name and address of the person responsible for its contents. With the help of the American Civil Liberties Union, McIntyre appealed the fine in court. The county court reversed the fine, holding that because McIntyre did not attempt to mislead the public, the Ohio statute was unconstitutional as it applied to her actions. However, the state court of appeals reinstated the fine, referring to a 1922 decision by the Ohio Supreme Court as precedent, and the Ohio Supreme Court affirmed.
The U.S. Supreme Court reversed the Ohio Supreme Court on April 19, 1995. As precedent, the Court referred to its decision in Talley v. California (1960), in which the Court found a similar law prohibiting anonymous leafletting unconstitutional, as well as the role of anonymous political literature throughout history, one example being The Federalist Papers. The Court's majority opinion emphasized the importance of anonymous speech, describing it as ""not a pernicious, fraudulent practice, but an honorable tradition of advocacy and of dissent"". The effect of the Court's opinion on anonymous speech has been analyzed in the contexts of television and radio advertisements, campaign finance, and the Internet.",wiki
"United States v. O'Brien, 391 U.S. 367 (1968), was a landmark decision of the United States Supreme Court, ruling that a criminal prohibition against burning a draft card did not violate the First Amendment's guarantee of free speech. Though the court recognized that O'Brien's conduct was expressive as a protest against the Vietnam War, it considered the law justified by a significant government interest unrelated to the suppression of speech and was tailored towards that end.
O'Brien upheld the government's power to prosecute what was becoming a pervasive method of anti-war protest. Its more significant legacy, however, was its application of a new constitutional standard. The test articulated in O'Brien has been subsequently used by the court to analyze whether laws that have the effect of regulating speech, though are ostensibly neutral towards the content of that speech, violate the First Amendment. Though the O'Brien test has rarely invalidated laws that the court has found to be ""content neutral"", it has given those engaging in expressive conduct—from wearing of black armbands to burning of flags— an additional tool to invoke against prohibitions.",wiki
"Elkins v. United States, 364 U.S. 206 (1960), was a US Supreme Court decision that held the ""silver platter doctrine"", which allowed federal prosecutors to use evidence illegally gathered by state police, to be a violation of the Fourth Amendment to the United States Constitution.
Evidence of illegal wiretapping had been seized from the home of James Butler Elkins by Portland, Oregon police officers on an unrelated search warrant, and he was subsequently convicted in federal court. Elkins appealed, arguing that evidence found by the officers should have been inadmissible under the exclusionary rule, which forbids the introduction of most evidence gathered through Fourth Amendment violations in criminal court.
In a 5–4 decision, the Court overturned the silver platter doctrine and Elkins' conviction. Associate Justice Potter Stewart wrote the majority opinion, while Associate Justices Felix Frankfurter and John M. Harlan II dissented. By giving a rationale for a broader interpretation of Fourth Amendment rights, the decision prepared the way for Mapp v. Ohio (1961), which applied the exclusionary rule to the states.",wiki

"Bartlett v. Strickland, 556 U.S. 1 (2009), is a United States Supreme Court case in which a plurality of the Court held that a minority group must constitute a numerical majority of the voting-age population in an area before section 2 of the Voting Rights Act requires the creation of a legislative district to prevent dilution of that group's votes.
The decision struck down a North Carolina redistricting plan that attempted to preserve minority voting power in a 39% black North Carolina House of Representatives district.
Justice Kennedy delivered the decision and was joined by Justices Alito and Roberts. Justice Thomas filed a concurring opinion that was joined by Justice Scalia. Justice Souter filed a dissenting opinion that was joined by Justices Stevens, Ginsburg, and Breyer. Justices Ginsburg and Breyer also filed separate dissenting opinions.
Justice Thomas argued that Section 2 does not protect against vote dilution, a position that he still holds as of 2023.
Justice Souter discussed how minority voters can elect their representatives of choice by winning crossover white voters despite not having an outright majority. Souter expressed concern that the majority's holding could lead to promoting racial blocs in order to create a minority-majority district when such a situation could be remedied by creating a crossover district. Justice Ginsburg called on Congress to amend Section 2 to supersede this ruling. Justice Breyer wrote that a flat 50% rule is impractical because no voting groups are 100% cohesive.
Despite not having a black majority, the black population in that district showed that it could elect candidates of its choice due to crossover white voters. A commentator warned ""Under the
Court’s ruling, for example, there is a danger that a jurisdiction may attempt to pack as
many minority voters as possible into districts that are already safe majority-minority
districts as an intentional effort to dilute minority voting strength in neighboring
crossover districts, and thereby prevent minority voters in those districts from electing
their candidates of choice. Similarly, if a compact minority population is electing
candidates of its choice in a crossover district, a jurisdiction may respond by fragmenting
that minority population into multiple districts in which minority voters would have no opportunity to elect their preferred candidates"".",wiki
"United States v. Davis, 370 U.S. 65 (1962), is a federal income tax case argued before the United States Supreme Court in 1962, holding that a taxpayer recognizes a gain on the transfer of appreciated property in satisfaction of a legal obligation.
In 1984, ""having heard criticism of the Davis/Farid rule for many years,"" Congress overruled the main holding: Under § 1041(a), no gain or loss shall be recognized by the transferor-spouse (or former spouse, but ""only if the transfer is incident to divorce""); as a corollary, §1041(b) provides that transferor's basis shall carry over into the hands of the transferee-spouse.

"Bryan v. Itasca County, 426 U.S. 373 (1976), was a case in which the Supreme Court of the United States held that a state did not have the right to assess a tax on the property of a Native American (Indian) living on tribal land absent a specific Congressional grant of authority to do so.
The case arose when a Minnesota county taxed an Indian's mobile home located on the reservation. The Court ruled that the state did not have the authority to impose such a tax or, more generally, to regulate behavior on the reservation. Bryan has become a landmark case that has led to Indian gaming on reservations and altered the economic status of almost every Indian tribe. Later decisions, citing Bryan, ruled that Public Law 280 allows states to enact prohibitions, or crimes, that would apply on reservations, but could not impose regulations on conduct that was otherwise allowed. The case has also called into question the ability of the states to impose any sort of regulations on tribal reservations, such as labor standards and certain traffic regulations.",wiki

Defenders of Wildlife, 504 U.S. 555 (1992), was a landmark Supreme Court of the United States decision, handed down on June 12, 1992, that heightened standing requirements under Article III of the United States Constitution. It is ""one of the most influential cases in modern environmental standing jurisprudence."" Lily Henning of the Legal Times stated that:

In [this] decision, hailed by the right and attacked by the left as well as by a broad swath of legal scholars, the Court made clear that plaintiffs must suffer a concrete, discernible injury—not a ""conjectural or hypothetical one""—to be able to bring suit in federal court. It, in effect, made it more difficult for plaintiffs to challenge the actions of a government agency when the actions don't directly affect them.
In Lujan, the Court held that a group of American wildlife conservation and other environmental organizations lacked standing to challenge regulations jointly issued by the U.S. Secretaries of the Interior  and Commerce, regarding the geographic area to which a particular section of the Endangered Species Act of 1973 applied. The case arose over issues of US funding of development projects in Aswan, Egypt and Mahaweli, Sri Lanka that could harm endangered species in the affected areas.

"Parker v.

The algorithm itself must be considered as if it were part of the prior art, and the claim must be considered as a whole. The exact quotation from the majority opinion is:
""Respondent’s process is unpatentable under §101, not because it contains a mathematical algorithm as one component, but because once that algorithm is assumed to be within the prior art, the application, considered as a whole, contains no patentable invention."" ""The fact that the algorithm may not have actually been known previously and that, when taken in combination with other claim elements, it might produce an invention that is novel
and nonobvious, plays no part in the analysis.""

"United States v. Enmons, 410 U.S. 396 (1973), was a United States Supreme Court case in which the Court held that the federal Anti-Racketeering Act of 1934, known as the Hobbs Act,  does not cover union violence in furtherance of the union's objectives.
The case involved a labor strike in which members of the International Brotherhood of Electrical Workers (IBEW) fired rifles at three utility company transformers, drained the oil from another, and blew up a company substation. The labor union in question was seeking a higher-pay contract and other benefits from their employer, the Gulf States Utilities Company which is now part of Entergy. The federal government tried the defendants under the Hobbs Act.
The Court ruled that ""The Hobbs Act, which makes it a federal crime to obstruct interstate commerce by robbery or extortion, does not reach the use of violence (which is readily punishable under state law) to achieve legitimate union objectives, such as higher wages in return for genuine services that the employer seeks.""",wiki

Although an undercover federal agent had helped procure a key ingredient for an illegal methamphetamine manufacturing operation, and assisted in the process, the Court followed its earlier rulings on the subject and found that the defendant had a predisposition to make and sell illegal drugs whether he worked with the government or not.
Russell had admitted to that during his appeal, but he and his lawyers argued that the entrapment defense should focus entirely on what the federal operatives did and not his state of mind.

But Justice William Rehnquist pondered the possibility that what has become known as ""outrageous government conduct"" might force a judicial hand in an entrapment case regardless of any specific rights that had been or not been violated. While he backed away from it in a later opinion, his words have become a rallying point for advocates of the objective entrapment standard.",wiki
"United States v. Students Challenging Regulatory Agency Procedures (SCRAP), 412 U.S. 669 (1973), was a landmark decision of the United States Supreme Court in which the Court held that the members of SCRAP—five law students from the George Washington University Law School—had standing to sue under Article III of the Constitution to challenge a nationwide railroad freight rate increase approved by the Interstate Commerce Commission (ICC). SCRAP was the first full-court consideration of the National Environmental Policy Act (NEPA).

"Solem v. Helm, 463 U.S. 277 (1983), was a United States Supreme Court case concerned with the scope of the Eighth Amendment protection from cruel and unusual punishment.  Mr. Helm, who had written a check from a fictitious account and had reached his seventh nonviolent felony conviction since 1964, received a mandatory sentence, under South Dakota law at that time, to life in prison with no parole. Petitioner Mr. Solem was the warden of the South Dakota State Penitentiary at the time.
The Court overturned the sentence on the grounds that it was ""cruel and unusual"". Justice Powell wrote for the five-member majority, while Chief Justice Burger wrote for the four-member dissent. Justice Powell reasoned that Helm had ""received the penultimate sentence for relatively minor criminal conduct."" Chief Justice Burger's concerns reflected his strict constructionist attitude: ""Suppose several states punish severely a crime that the Court views as trivial or petty? I can see no limiting principle in the Court's holding.""
The language of the opinion, however, refrained from striking down state statutes setting minimum sentencing guidelines for recidivism. The majority opinion only called for exceptions to the statutes protecting the constitutional freedom from cruel and unusual punishment.
In addition, the Court sought to use this particular case to clarify the Proportionality Doctrine previously proposed in Enmund v. Florida (1982) by setting precise guidelines for deciding whether a punishment is proportional to the specific crime committed. The Court ruled that all courts must do three things to decide whether a sentence is proportional to a specific crime:

Compare the nature and gravity of the offense and the harshness of the penalty,
Compare the sentences imposed on other criminals in the same jurisdiction; i.e., whether more serious crimes are subject to the same penalty or to less serious penalties, and
Compare the sentences imposed for commission of the same crime in other jurisdictions.",wiki
"Harman v. Forssenius, 380 U.S. 528 (1965), was a United States Supreme Court case in which the Court ruled that Virginia's partial elimination of the poll tax violated the Twenty-fourth Amendment to the United States Constitution.
Virginia attempted to avoid the effect of the 24th Amendment by creating an ""escape clause"" to the poll tax. In lieu of paying the poll tax, a prospective voter could apply for a certificate establishing a place of residence in Virginia. The application had to be made six months prior to an election, a measure expected to decrease the number of eligible voters.
In the 1965 Supreme Court decision of Harman v. Forssenius, the Court unanimously found such measures unconstitutional and declared that, for federal elections, ""the poll tax is abolished absolutely as a prerequisite to voting, and no equivalent or milder substitute may be imposed.""",wiki
"Memoirs v. Massachusetts, 383 U.S. 413 (1966), was the United States Supreme Court decision that attempted to clarify a holding regarding obscenity made a decade earlier in Roth v. United States (1957).
The Roth ruling established that for a work of literature to be considered obscene, it had to be proven by censors to: 1) appeal to prurient interest, 2) be patently offensive, and 3) have no redeeming social value.  The literature in Roth v. United States was Fanny Hill (or Memoirs of a Woman of Pleasure, 1749) by John Cleland and the Court held in Memoirs v. Massachusetts that, while it might fit the first two criteria (it appealed to prurient interest and was patently offensive), it could not be proven that Fanny Hill had no redeeming social value. The judgment favoring the plaintiff continued that it could still be held obscene under certain circumstances –  for instance, if it were marketed solely for its prurient appeal.
Memoirs v. Massachusetts led to more years of debate about what is and is not obscene, eventually conferring more power in these matters to proposers of local community standards.",wiki
"Sale v. Haitian Centers Council, 509 U.S. 155 (1993), is a case in which the U.S. Supreme Court ruled that the President's executive order that all aliens intercepted on the high seas could be repatriated was not limited by the Immigration and Nationality Act of 1952 or Article 33 of the United Nations Convention Relating to the Status of Refugees.
Originally, the United States and the Haitian government made an agreement in 1981 to stop all vessels coming to the United States and return any undocumented aliens who were not refugees and would not be harmed upon return.
After a regime change in Haiti, American policy changed and was interpreted that all undocumented aliens would be sent back unless they landed and made an entry onto the territory of the United States.
The case came before the court on March 2, 1993, and was decided on June 21, 1993. The oral argument for the plaintiff was made by then Yale law professor Harold Koh (from 2009 to 2013, Koh was the Legal Adviser of the Department of State).
The 8–1 decision was delivered by Justice John Paul Stevens with Justice Harry Blackmun dissenting, and overturned a decision of the Second Circuit Court of Appeals.
Criticizing the majority decision in his dissent, Justice Blackmun wrote, ""Today's majority ... decides that the forced repatriation of the Haitian refugees is perfectly legal, because the word ""return"" does not mean return, because the opposite of ""within the United States"" is not outside the United States, and because the official charged with controlling immigration has no role in enforcing an order to control immigration."" (citations omitted)
A slightly different case with the name Haitian Centers Council v. Sale was argued and won by Koh's team of law students from Yale before Judge Sterling Johnson of the U.S. District Court for the Eastern District of New York. Lead counsel was provided on a pro bono basis by Joe Tringali of Simpson Thacher & Bartlett. However, this decision was later vacated due to a negotiated settlement deal made by the Clinton Administration and Yale Law School.

The Petitioners, Madsen and other abortion protesters (Petitioners) regularly protested the Respondents, the Women’s Health Center and other abortion clinics (Respondent), in Melbourne, Florida as well as in front of the homes of clinic employees. The Respondents then sought and were granted, by a Florida trial court, an injunction on several grounds, restraining the Petitioner’s ability to protest, which was upheld by the Florida Supreme Court.

The Stanford Daily filed a suit claiming that under the protection of the First and Fourth Amendments of the Constitution, the warrants were unconstitutional and that the searches should have fallen under the context of subpoenas. The Supreme Court ruled against The Stanford Daily; however, Congress later passed the Privacy Protection Act of 1980, which provides additional protections against searches and seizures to the press and individuals who disseminate information to the public, unless the individual is suspected of a crime or a life-threatening situation is present.",wiki

This case clarified the Mobile-Sierra doctrine established by United Gas Pipe Line Co. v. Mobile Gas Service Corp. (1956) and its companion case Federal Power Commission v. Sierra Pacific Power Co.

"California v. Ciraolo, 476 U.S. 207 (1986), was a decision by the Supreme Court of the United States in which the Court held that aerial observation of a person's backyard by police, even if done without a search warrant, does not violate the Fourth Amendment to the U.S. Constitution. 
In the case, police in Santa Clara, California flew a private airplane over the property of Dante Ciraolo and took aerial photographs of his backyard after receiving an anonymous tip that he was growing marijuana plants.
Some legal scholars have called this case ""the demise of private property"" and that it contradicts prior case law such as Katz v.

"United States v. Thirty-seven Photographs, 402 U.S. 363 (1971), is a United States Supreme Court decision in an in rem case on procedures following the seizure of imported obscene material. A 6–3 court held that the federal statute governing the seizures was not in violation of the First Amendment as long as the government began forfeiture proceedings within 14 days of the seizure.
The case began with the seizure of the photographs, depicting various sexual positions, from Milton Luros, a Southern California publisher who was returning from Europe. He had intended to use them to illustrate a volume of the Kama Sutra, or failing that, to keep them for his own personal use. A district court panel, guided by the Court's Freedman v. Maryland decision of several years before, rejected his claims that the First Amendment allowed citizens to import obscene material, but found the statute unconstitutional due to the lack of time limits and ordered the Customs Service to return the images to Luros. The government appealed directly to the Supreme Court.
Justice Byron White wrote for the majority, distinguishing the case from Freedman v. Maryland, which had also involved time limits, by noting that it was a federal statute rather than a state one and therefore the Court could give it an authoritative construction. John Marshall Harlan and Potter Stewart also wrote concurring opinions expanding on aspects of the majority holding. Stewart did not agree with the majority that the ban on personal importation of obscene material was consistent with Stanley v. Georgia.
The dissenting justices wrote two opinions. Hugo Black and William O. Douglas took issue with every aspect of the holding, believing the government had no power to regulate obscenity. Thurgood Marshall agreed with them and Stewart that the blanket importation ban was constitutional. That issue would be reconsidered in a similar case two years later, United States v. 12 200-ft. Reels of Film. The case would have little impact on the future development of obscenity law. It has, however, been cited as the first forfeiture case to deal with the question of time limits, and also reaffirmed a principle by which the Court avoids dealing with constitutional questions when it can through alternative constructions.",wiki

Furthermore, this Act stated that material that was preserved could be used in judicial hearings and proceedings.  Immediately after this Act was enacted, Richard Nixon filed a lawsuit in a federal district court claiming that the Act violated the principle of separation of powers, the principle of presidential privilege, Nixon's personal privacy, his First Amendment right of association, and further asserted that it amounted to a constitutionally prohibited Bill of Attainder.",wiki
"Bates v. State Bar of Arizona, 433 U.S. 350 (1977), was a United States Supreme Court case in which the Court upheld the right of lawyers to advertise their services. In holding that lawyer advertising was commercial speech entitled to protection under the First Amendment (incorporated against the States through the Fourteenth Amendment), the Court upset the tradition against advertising by lawyers, rejecting it as an antiquated rule of etiquette.
The Court emphasized the benefits of the information that flows to consumers through advertising, positing that lawyer advertising would make legal services more accessible to the general public and improve the overall administration of justice. The Court had previously held in Virginia State Pharmacy Board v.

The Parke, Davis & Co. case held that, when a company goes beyond ""the limited dispensation"" of Colgate by taking affirmative steps to induce adherence to its suggested prices, it puts together a combination among competitors to fix prices in violation of § 1 of the Sherman Act.

"Payton v. New York, 445 U.S. 573 (1980), was a United States Supreme Court case concerning warrantless entry into a private home in order to make a felony arrest. The Court struck down a New York statute providing for such warrantless entries because the Fourth Amendment draws a firm line at the entrance to the house. Absent exigent circumstances, that threshold may not be reasonably crossed without a warrant. The court, however, did specify that an arrest warrant (as opposed to a search warrant) would have sufficed for entry into the suspect's residence if there had been reason to believe that the suspect was within the home.

"Hills v. Gautreaux, 425 U.S. 284 (1976), was a decision of the United States Supreme Court.
In this case, a number of Chicago families living in housing projects were awarded Section 8 vouchers allowing them to move to the suburbs in compensation for the housing project's substandard conditions.  Carla Anderson Hills was the United States Secretary of Housing and Urban Development; the eponymous lead respondent was Dorothy Gautreaux (1927–1968). The court ruled that the department had violated the Fifth Amendment and the Civil Rights Act of 1964.
The significance of the case lies in the sociological conclusions that can be drawn from it. A number of families chose to move, while others stayed, and Northwestern University researchers studying the two populations concluded that low-income women who moved to the suburbs ""clearly experienced improved employment and earnings, even though the program provided no job training or placement services."" The disparity arguably proves that concentrated poverty is self-perpetuating and simply alleviating this concentration offers an avenue for improving the quality of life of those affected by urban poverty.",wiki
"Buckley v. Valeo, 424 U.S. 1 (1976), was a landmark decision of the US Supreme Court on campaign finance. A majority of justices held that, as provided by section 608 of the Federal Election Campaign Act of 1971, limits on election expenditures are unconstitutional. In a per curiam (by the Court) opinion, they ruled that expenditure limits contravene the First Amendment provision on freedom of speech because a restriction on spending for political communication necessarily reduces the quantity of expression. It limited disclosure provisions and limited the Federal Election Commission's power. Justice Byron White dissented in part and wrote that Congress had legitimately recognized unlimited election spending ""as a mortal danger against which effective preventive and curative steps must be taken"".
Buckley v. Valeo was extended by the U.S. Supreme Court in further cases, including in the five to four decision of First National Bank of Boston v. Bellotti in 1978 and Citizens United v. Federal Election Commission in 2010. The latter held that corporations may spend from their general treasuries during elections. In 2014, McCutcheon v.

The reasonableness of surgical intrusions beneath the skin depends on a case-by-case approach, in which the individual's interests in privacy and security are weighed against society's interests in conducting the procedure to obtain evidence for fairly determining guilt or innocence.

"Hughes v. Alexandria Scrap Corp., 426 U.S. 794 (1976), was a case argued before the Supreme Court of the United States.  Maryland created a program that, 1) purchased junked cars, 2) paid a bounty for those with Maryland license plates and, 3) imposed more stringent documentation requirements on out-of-state processors, in an effort to reduce the number of abandoned cars in Maryland.
The Issue before the Court is whether such a program violates the Dormant Commerce Clause—essentially, whether Maryland could Constitutionally discriminate or burden interstate commerce by imposing more stringent documentation requirements on out-of-state processors or favoring in-state car dealerships when they purchase junk cars.
Unlike previous Dormant Commerce Clause cases, Maryland was acting like a market participant (as opposed to a state regulator).  In such instances, the Court determined that a state actor can favor its own citizens over the foreign citizens.
This case created the ""market participant"" exception to the general restrictions on states imposed by the Dormant Commerce Clause.
Determining when a state is acting like a ""market participant"" rather than as a regulator was not decided by this case, but found in South Central Timber Development v. Wunnicke.",wiki
"Dean Witter Reynolds Inc. v. Byrd, 470 U.S. 213 (1985), is a United States Supreme Court case concerning arbitration. It arose from an interlocutory appeal of a lower court's denial of brokerage firm Dean Witter Reynolds' motion to compel arbitration of the claims under state law made against it by an aggrieved former client. The Court held unanimously that the Federal Arbitration Act required that those claims be heard that way when the parties were contractually obligated to do so, even where parallel claims made under federal law would still be heard in federal court.
Justice Thurgood Marshall wrote for the court, resolving a conflict between the appellate circuits; Byron White added a concurrence in which he noted some issues with the underlying securities law that were not before the Court but, he felt, could in future cases make it harder for parties such as Byrd to claim that federal law always allowed them to litigate private actions for securities fraud. In the aftermath of the decision many district courts followed his opinion, leading to later Supreme Court rulings that greatly favored arbitration over litigation in securities disputes. It has been described as completing the federalization of American arbitration law.",wiki
"Oklahoma Tax Commission v. Sac & Fox Nation, 508 U.S. 114 (1993), was a case in which the Supreme Court of the United States held that absent explicit congressional direction to the contrary, it must be presumed that a State does not have jurisdiction to tax tribal members who live and work in Indian country, whether the particular territory consists of a formal or informal reservation, allotted lands, or dependent Indian communities.
The Sac and Fox Nation is an Indian (Native American) tribe that governs itself under the Indian Self-Determination Act and imposes taxes based on that authority.  The State of Oklahoma sought to impose income and motor vehicle taxes on tribal members.  The tribe brought suit to prevent the state from imposing those taxes.
Both the Tenth Circuit Court of Appeals and the Supreme Court held that Oklahoma, without a clear authorization from Congress, was prohibited from imposing taxes on tribal members in Indian country.  This case, together with several other cases, are known as the ""Oklahoma tax cases"" in Native American case law.",wiki

"United States v. Winstar Corp., 518 U.S. 839 (1996), was a decision by the United States Supreme Court which held that the United States Government had breached its contractual obligations. The court in Winstar rejected the Government's ""unmistakability defense""—that surrenders of sovereign authority, such as the promise to refrain from regulatory changes, must appear in unmistakable terms in a contract in order to be enforceable.
Winstar arose as a consequence of the savings and loan crisis. Federal regulators had allowed ""supervisory goodwill"" to be counted as regulatory capital for financial institutions that took over failing thrifts.  Congress later passed the Financial Institutions Reform, Recovery, and Enforcement Act of 1989, which substantially changed these advantages and one of the successor banks successfully sued. The United States Court of Appeals for the Federal Circuit found a breach of contract and awarded damages—the Supreme Court upheld the lower court decision.  ""Winstar"" cases resulted in multimillion-dollar payouts to plaintiffs. As of July 31, 2000, there were 13 settlements or judgments totaling $1.158 billion against the federal government, with more than 100 more cases pending, as a result of the Winstar decision.

The Court ruled that this practice violated the Equal Protection Clause of the Fourteenth Amendment. The case gave rise to the term Batson challenge, an objection to a peremptory challenge based on the standard established by the Supreme Court's decision in this case.  Subsequent jurisprudence has resulted in the extension of Batson to civil cases (Edmonson v. Leesville Concrete Company) and cases where jurors are excluded on the basis of sex (J.E.B. v.

"Pearson v. Callahan, 555 U.S. 223 (2009), was a case decided by the United States Supreme Court dealing with the doctrine of qualified immunity.
The case centered on the application of mandatory sequencing in determining qualified immunity as set by the 2001 decision, Saucier v. Katz, in which courts were to first ask whether a constitutional right was clearly violated by a government official at the time of the action before evaluating if a law had clearly been broken. The Court took to the unusual step of asking the parties to argue whether past precedent should be overturned. The theory under Saucier is that without courts first ruling on constitutional questions, the law would go undeveloped in many areas. Many legal commentators have criticized the ruling in Saucier.
The Supreme Court, in its opinion, withdrew the mandatory sequencing required under Saucier, giving courts the discretion of asking the constitutional or law question first. While this discretionary approach can free resources of the court, it has led to additional criticism, as it can often favor defendants, particularly in cases involving excessive force and police brutality.

"United States v. Payner, 447 U.S. 727 (1980), is a United States Supreme Court case in which the Court reversed a district court's suppression of evidence in the criminal prosecution of an Ohio businessman charged with tax evasion. The case concerned both issues of criminal procedure and the application of the exclusionary rule derived from the Fourth Amendment. By a 6–3 margin the Court both reaffirmed its earlier rulings' holding that only the party whose Fourth Amendment protections may have been violated has standing to challenge the evidence seized in the search, and barred lower courts from exercising their supervisory power to exclude such evidence at the trial of third parties.
The case had been brought as the fruit of Operation Trade Winds, a lengthy Internal Revenue Service (IRS) investigation into the use of offshore accounts in tax havens by American citizens attempting to evade tax liability and hide assets, some of which were believed to have been derived from criminal activities. At one point, a private investigator working with a Florida IRS agent had taken the executive's briefcase for the IRS to open and duplicate the documents within, then returned the briefcase. (This aspect was described by the district judge as the ""briefcase caper"", a sobriquet  which has subsequently become attached to the case as a whole). Subpoenas based on the information in those documents yielded the documents used in a prosecution later of Ohio businessman Jack Payner.
Lewis Powell wrote for the majority that prior case law gave Payner no reasonable expectation of privacy in the documents used to build the case against him. While the Court, too, was outraged by the IRS agent's disregard for the law, the judicial branch's supervisory power was meant to be used only against its own excesses, and Congress was better equipped to remedy such breaches of the Constitution since there were no ways to limit how a court might apply such a rule. Thurgood Marshall's dissent noted not only the extent to which the IRS had gone in planning the briefcase caper but that its agents had purposely been instructed to take advantage of the loophole created by the court's standing rule. Later commentators read the case as expanding the standing rule, and indicating a shift to focusing on the deterrence effect of applying the exclusionary rule instead of the courts' supervisory role.",wiki

"Arizona Christian School Tuition Organization v. Winn, 563 U.S. 125 (2011), is a decision by the Supreme Court of the United States involving taxpayer standing under Article Three of the United States Constitution.
A group of Arizona taxpayers challenged a state law providing tax credits to people who donate to school tuition organizations providing scholarships to students attending private or religious schools. The taxpayers claimed a violation of the Establishment Clause. The District Court dismissed the case, holding that the taxpayers did not state a valid claim. The decision was reversed by the Ninth Circuit, which ruled that the respondents had standing to sue, citing Flast v. Cohen.
The Supreme Court ruled 5–4, in an opinion delivered by Justice Anthony Kennedy, that the plaintiffs did not have standing to bring suit. The Court stated that it had ""rejected the general proposition that an individual who has paid taxes has a 'continuing, legally cognizable interest in ensuring that those funds are not used by the Government in a way that violates the Constitution.'"" Ultimately, the Supreme Court found that any damages or harm claimed by the taxpayers by virtue of simply being a taxpayer would be pure speculation because the issue at hand was a tax credit and not a government expenditure. Justice Scalia filed a concurring opinion, joined by Justice Thomas.
In her dissent, Justice Kagan said ""cash grants and targeted tax breaks are means of accomplishing the same government objective—to provide financial support to select individuals or organizations."" She further argued: ""taxpayers should be able to challenge the subsidy."" The dissent was joined by Justices Ginsburg, Breyer, and Sotomayor. Bruce Peabody, a political science professor at Fairleigh Dickinson University, remarked ""the case brought out four dissents, a signal that those justices were prepared to decide the substantive issue."" Equally, Peter Woolley, professor of political science and director of the PublicMind Poll, posited ""in making this ruling on such narrow grounds, the court virtually guarantees that plaintiff in one guise or another will be back another day.""",wiki
"Afroyim v. Rusk, 387 U.S. 253 (1967), was a landmark decision of the Supreme Court of the United States, which ruled that citizens of the United States may not be deprived of their citizenship involuntarily. The U.S. government had attempted to revoke the citizenship of Beys Afroyim, a man born in Poland, because he had cast a vote in an Israeli election after becoming a naturalized U.S. citizen. The Supreme Court decided that Afroyim's right to retain his citizenship was guaranteed by the Citizenship Clause of the Fourteenth Amendment to the Constitution. In so doing, the Court struck down a federal law mandating loss of U.S. citizenship for voting in a foreign election—thereby overruling one of its own precedents, Perez v. Brownell (1958), in which it had upheld loss of citizenship under similar circumstances less than a decade earlier.
The Afroyim decision opened the way for a wider acceptance of dual (or multiple) citizenship in United States law. The Bancroft Treaties—a series of agreements between the United States and other nations which had sought to limit dual citizenship following naturalization—were eventually abandoned after the Carter administration concluded that Afroyim and other Supreme Court decisions had rendered them unenforceable.
The impact of Afroyim v. Rusk was narrowed by a later case, Rogers v. Bellei (1971), in which the Court determined that the Fourteenth Amendment safeguarded citizenship only when a person was born or naturalized in the United States, and that Congress retained authority to regulate the citizenship status of a person who was born outside the United States to an American parent. However, the specific law at issue in Rogers v. Bellei—a requirement for a minimum period of U.S. residence that Bellei had failed to satisfy—was repealed by Congress in 1978.  As a consequence of revised policies adopted in 1990 by the United States Department of State, it is now (in the words of one expert) ""virtually impossible to lose American citizenship without formally and expressly renouncing it.""

The plaintiffs argued that, as their county had a 45% population of African-Americans, it was discrimination and unfair to have been presented with all-white or nearly all-white juries each time. Thus, the Supreme Court – as well as overturning the convictions – ruled that Georgia renew its jury selection policies.

"Commissioner v. Soliman, 506 U.S. 168 (1993), was a case heard before the United States Supreme Court in which the court decided whether a portion of a dwelling unit exclusively used as a principal place of business for any trade or business of a taxpayer would allow a deduction to the taxpayer's income taxes under Internal Revenue Code Section 280A(c)(1)(A).
Soliman was an anesthesiologist who spent thirty to thirty-five hours per week with patients at three different hospitals but none of the hospitals provided him with an office. He used a spare bedroom in his house for contacting patients and surgeons, maintaining billing records, preparing for treatments, and reading medical journals.
The Supreme Court denied Soliman's home office deduction setting forth a two consideration test for whether the home was the taxpayer's principal place of business: (1) the relative importance of the activities performed, and (2) time spent at each place.
Congress's reaction to this decision was to amend Section 280A(c) in the Taxpayer Relief Act of 1997 so that a home office could meet the ""principal place of business"" test if it is the only fixed location where administrative or management activities are performed.

"Santosky v. Kramer, 455 U.S. 745 (1982), is a Supreme Court case involving the burden of proof for the revocation of parental rights. The case arose when the Ulster County, New York, Department of Social Services sought to revoke John Santosky II and Annie Santosky's parental rights to their three children. Under Section 622 of the New York State Family Court Act, the state was permitted to revoke parental rights to a natural child if, after a fair preponderance of the evidence, a court found ""permanent neglect."" The New York State Family Court found such neglect by using the ""fair preponderance"" standard. The Appellate Division of the New York Supreme Court upheld the constitutionality of the burden of proof used.
In a 5–4 opinion written by Associate Justice Harry Blackmun, the Supreme Court of the United States reversed and vacated the Appellate Division's ruling, holding that states seeking to sever parental rights irrevocably must show at least clear and convincing evidence of neglect. Justice William Rehnquist, joined by three others, dissented, on the grounds that the majority's focus on a single aspect of the law disregarded the fairness of the scheme as a whole. The ruling has since been criticized for its intrusion into state affairs. Because of the ruling, all states previously using the fair preponderance standard changed to the clear and convincing standard, but California has since abandoned the clear and convincing standard and returned to the fair preponderance standard.

"Gertz v. Robert Welch, Inc., 418 U.S. 323 (1974), was a landmark decision of the US Supreme Court establishing the standard of First Amendment protection against defamation claims brought by private individuals.  The Court held that, so long as they do not impose liability without fault, states are free to establish their own standards of liability for defamatory statements made about private individuals.  However, the Court also ruled that if the state standard is lower than actual malice, the standard applying to public figures, then only actual damages may be awarded.
The consequence is that strict liability for defamation is unconstitutional in the United States; the plaintiff must be able to show that the defendant acted negligently or with an even higher level of mens rea.  In many other common law countries, strict liability for defamation is still the rule.

"Kissinger v. Reporters Committee for Freedom of the Press, 445 U.S. 136 (1980), is a decision by the Supreme Court of the United States involving the Freedom of Information Act.  The Supreme Court ruled that Henry Kissinger was not required under the Act to turn over transcripts of phone conversations he made as an adviser to President Richard Nixon.
By a 5–2 margin, the court overturned the decisions of two lower Federal courts and decided that Kissinger's removal of the transcripts from the State Department removed the documents from the purview of the Freedom of Information Act. In his opinion for the majority, Associate Justice William H. Rehnquist noted that once the documents had been withdrawn, ""the agency has neither the custody or control necessary to enable it to withhold.""
Kissinger had removed thousands of pages of the phone transcripts in the waning days of his term as Secretary of State. The documents were first stored at Nelson Rockefeller's Kykuit estate in Westchester County, New York and were later given to the Library of Congress. In a decision affirmed by the United States Court of Appeals, the United States District Court ruled that Kissinger had ""wrongfully removed"" the documents and ordered the Library of Congress to return the papers to the State Department so that they could be processed for disclosure.
The Supreme Court confirmed the decisions of the lower courts that Kissinger's transcripts when he was Richard Nixon's national security advisor did not fall under the purview of the Freedom of Information Act, nor would it apply to any other members of a President's executive office staff. The only documents that were legitimately covered by the request would have been from his term as Secretary of State from September 1973 to January 1977.",wiki

"United States v. Feola, 420 U.S. 671 (1975), is a United States Supreme Court case in which the court held that conspiracy to assault a federal officer, like the substantive crime of assaulting a federal officer, doesn't require knowledge that the victims were federal officers.
The case involved a drug ""rip-off"" in which the defendant and his co-conspirators agreed to sell sugar as heroin to unsuspecting buyers. They agreed that if the buyers discovered their ruse, they would jump the buyers and take their money. The sellers didn't know that the buyers were all undercover federal narcotics agents. Although the sellers tried to assault one of the agents, another agent pulled out his revolver and the agents eventually arrested the sellers.
The court's opinion addressed—and eventually dispensed with—Judge Learned Hand's famous analogy in United States v. Crimmins 123 F.2d 271, 273 (2d Cir. 1941). Hand noted that conspiracy to commit mail fraud was akin to conspiracy to run a red light - both substantive crimes don't require knowledge beforehand. But agreement or conspiracy requires knowledge that there is such a red light, or that the mails will be used. The Court characterized this analogy as ""effective prose...[but]...bad law."" 420, at 689-90. The court argued that conspiracy agreements don't require agreement on every point of the crime, and so imposing a higher agreement requirement for a conspiracy to assault was illogical in light of the policy reasons for criminalizing conspiracy. The court identified these reasons as protecting society from concerted criminal activity and the social threat posed even by an inchoate crime.
Instead the court reasoned that because the conspiracy statute didn't require a higher mens rea than the substantive crime, the same mens rea requirement applies to both by default. The court reasoned that one purpose of the assault statute was to provide a federal forum (specific jurisdiction) for assaults on federal officers. Therefore, conspiracy to assault a federal officer didn't require proof that the defendant knew that his intended victim was a federal officer.
Justice Potter Stewart dissented, arguing that the structure of the assault statute and legislative history of its predecessor supported his interpretation that the statute only applied if the defendant knew his victim was a federal officer.",wiki

The majority opinion, reversing the District Court, stated that the appellees did not sufficiently prove a textual basis, within the U.S. Constitution, supporting the principle that education is a fundamental right. Urging that the school financing system led to wealth-based discrimination, the plaintiffs had argued that the fundamental right to education should be applied to the States, through the Fourteenth Amendment. The Court found that there was no such fundamental right and that the unequal school financing system was not subject to strict scrutiny.",wiki

"Apodaca v. Oregon, 406 U.S. 404 (1972), was a United States Supreme Court case in which the Court held that state juries may convict a defendant by a less-than-unanimous verdict in a felony criminal case. The four-justice plurality opinion of the court, written by Justice White, affirmed the judgment of the Oregon Court of Appeals and held that there was no constitutional right to a unanimous verdict. Although federal law requires federal juries to reach criminal verdicts unanimously, the Court held Oregon's practice did not violate the Sixth Amendment right to trial by jury and so allowed it to continue. In Johnson v. Louisiana, a case decided on the same day, the Court held that Louisiana's similar practice of allowing criminal convictions by a jury vote of 9–3 did not violate due process or equal protection under the Fourteenth Amendment.
Justice Powell, in his concurring opinion, argued that there was a constitutional right to a unanimous jury in the Sixth Amendment, but that the Fourteenth Amendment's Due Process Clause does not incorporate that right as applied to the states. This case is part of a line of cases interpreting if and how the Sixth Amendment is applied against the states through the Fourteenth Amendment for the purposes of incorporation doctrine, although the division of opinions prevented a clear-cut answer to that question in this case.

"DeFunis v. Odegaard, 416 U.S. 312 (1974), was a United States Supreme Court case in which the Court held that the case had become moot and so declined to render a decision on the merits. American student Marco DeFunis, who had been denied admission to the University of Washington School of Law in the state of Washington before he was provisionally admitted during the pendency of the case, was slated to graduate within a few months of the decision being rendered.
The Court rejected the assertion that the case was in one of two exceptions to the mootness doctrine that were raised by the plaintiff. The case did not constitute ""voluntary cessation"" on the part of the defendant law school, as the plaintiff was now in his final quarter, and the law school could take no action to deny him the ability to graduate. Also, it was not a question that was ""capable of repetition, yet evading review"" because the plaintiff would never again face the situation, and others who might raise the same complaint in the future might be able to receive the courts' full review.
DeFunis argued that materials brought to light during discovery and entered into evidence in the trial court showed that his initial denial of admission to the law school was the result of the operation of the law school's affirmative action policy, favoring the admission of minority applicants over better-qualified white candidates. Although the Court refused to consider the case on the merits in DeFunis, the issue of affirmative action returned to the Court without any problem of mootness, with an opinion on the merits achieved in Regents of the University of California v.

"Jenkins v. Georgia, 418 U.S. 153 (1974), was a United States Supreme Court case overturning a Georgia Supreme Court ruling regarding the depiction of sexual conduct in the film Carnal Knowledge.
The changes in the morals of American society of the 1960s and 1970s and the general receptiveness to the public to frank discussion of sexual issues was sometimes at odds with local community standards.  A theatre in Albany, Georgia showed the film. On January 13, 1972, the local police served a search warrant on the theatre, and seized the film. In March 1972, the theatre manager, Mr. Jenkins, was convicted of the crime of ""distributing obscene material"". His conviction was upheld by the Supreme Court of Georgia.
On June 24, 1974, the U.S. Supreme Court ruled that the State of Georgia had gone too far in classifying material as obscene in view of the Court's prior landmark decision in Miller v. California, 413 U.S. 15 (1973) (the Miller standard), and overturned the conviction. The court said,

Our own viewing of the film satisfies us that Carnal Knowledge could not be found ... to depict sexual conduct in a patently offensive way. Nothing in the movie falls within ... material which may constitutionally be found ... ""patently offensive"" ... While the subject matter of the picture is, in a broader sense, sex, and there are scenes in which sexual conduct including ""ultimate sexual acts"" is to be understood to be taking place, the camera does not focus on the bodies of the actors at such times. There is no exhibition whatever of the actors' genitals, lewd or otherwise, during these scenes. There are occasional scenes of nudity, but nudity alone is not enough to make material legally obscene ... Appellant's showing of the film Carnal Knowledge is simply not the ""public portrayal of hard core sexual conduct for its own sake, and for the ensuing commercial gain"" which we said was punishable ...",wiki

Whether a particular right is waivable; whether the defendant must participate personally in the waiver; whether certain procedures are required for waiver; and whether the defendant's choice must be particularly informed or voluntary, all depend on the right at stake.""
According to the Court, mere forfeiture, as opposed to waiver, does not extinguish an ""error"" under Rule 52(b) of the Federal Rules of Criminal Procedure.

"California v. Acevedo, 500 U.S. 565 (1991), was a decision of the United States Supreme Court, which interpreted the Carroll doctrine to provide one rule to govern all automobile searches. The Court stated, ""The police may search an automobile and the containers within it where they have probable cause to believe contraband or evidence is contained."" The decision also overruled the distinctions in United States v. Chadwick (1977) and Arkansas v. Sanders (1979) which had previously held that, if probable cause existed to search an automobile, the police may perform a warrantless search of the automobile and the containers within it, but if the police only had probable cause to search a container in the automobile, the police first had to obtain a warrant before searching the container.
It thereby confirmed Carroll v.

"Posadas de Puerto Rico Associates v.

In a 5–4 decision, the Supreme Court held that the Puerto Rico government (law) could restrict advertisement for casino gambling from being targeted to residents, even if the activity itself was legal and advertisement to tourists was permitted.  The U.S. Supreme Court affirmed the Puerto Rico Supreme Court conclusion, as construed by the Puerto Rico Superior Court, that the Act and regulations do not facially violate the First Amendment, nor did it violate the due process or Equal Protection Clauses of the Fourteenth Amendment.
The controversial case has been subsequently referenced with respect to the legality of bans on tobacco advertising, liquor advertising and other advertisement related to gambling. It is regarded as a landmark case in illustrating the elasticity of the Central Hudson standards for regulating commercial speech, as the Court did not request evidence or argument supporting the need of Puerto Rico to regulate such advertisement, but merely accepted that such regulations seemed reasonable. It also implicitly allowed for more strict regulations on commercial speech related to legal but presumably dangerous ""vice"" activities.

The decision cleared up the uncertainty left in the wake of District of Columbia v. Heller (2008) as to the scope of gun rights in regard to the states.
Initially, the Court of Appeals for the Seventh Circuit had upheld a Chicago ordinance banning the possession of handguns as well as other gun regulations affecting rifles and shotguns, citing United States v. Cruikshank (1876), Presser v. Illinois (1886), and Miller v. Texas (1894). The petition for certiorari was filed by Alan Gura, the attorney who had successfully argued Heller, and Chicago-area attorney David G. Sigale. The Second Amendment Foundation and the Illinois State Rifle Association sponsored the litigation on behalf of several Chicago residents, including retiree Otis McDonald.

"Louisiana ex rel. Francis v. Resweber, 329 U.S. 459 (1947), is a case in which the U.S. Supreme Court was asked whether imposing capital punishment (the electric chair) a second time, after it failed in an attempt to execute Willie Francis in 1946, constituted a violation of the United States Constitution. The issues raised surrounded the double jeopardy clause of the Fifth Amendment, and the cruel and unusual punishment clause of the Eighth Amendment, as made applicable to the State of Louisiana via the due process clause of the Fourteenth Amendment.
In an opinion by Justice Stanley Forman Reed, which three other justices (Chief Justice Vinson and Associate Justices Hugo Black and Robert H. Jackson) joined, and with which Justice Felix Frankfurter concurred, the Court held that re-executing Francis did not constitute double jeopardy or cruel and unusual punishment.  Justice Reed wrote,

Our minds rebel against permitting the same sovereignty to punish an accused twice for the same offense. But where the accused successfully seeks review of a conviction, there is no double jeopardy upon a new trial. Even where a state obtains a new trial after conviction because of errors, while an accused may be placed on trial a second time, it is not the sort of hardship to the accused that is forbidden by the Fourteenth Amendment ... For we see no difference from a constitutional point of view between a new trial for error of law at the instance of the state that results in a death sentence instead of imprisonment for life and an execution that follows a failure of equipment. When an accident, with no suggestion of malevolence, prevents the consummation of a sentence, the state's subsequent course in the administration of its criminal law is not affected on that account by any requirement of due process under the Fourteenth Amendment. We find no double jeopardy here which can be said to amount to a denial of federal due process in the proposed execution. (Citations omitted).
Dissenting, however, Justice Harold Burton (joined by Justices William O. Douglas, Frank Murphy, and Wiley Rutledge) argued, 

How many deliberate and intentional reapplications of electric current does it take to produce a cruel, unusual and unconstitutional punishment? While five applications would be more cruel and unusual than one, the uniqueness of the present case demonstrates that, today, two separated applications are sufficiently 'cruel and unusual' to be prohibited. If five attempts would be 'cruel and unusual,' it would be difficult to draw the line between two, three, four and five. It is not difficult, however, as we here contend, to draw the line between the one continuous application prescribed by statute and any other application of the current. Lack of intent that the first application be less than fatal is not material. The intent of the executioner cannot lessen the torture or excuse the result.
Francis was successfully executed the following year.",wiki

More broadly, the Dean Foods case stands for the proposition that a federal agency may, by invoking the ""All Writs Act,"" seek equitable relief in federal court against a person's threatened action that will substantially interfere with the agency's performance of its statutory duty and thus adversely affect the relevant court's ability to review the agency's ultimate order with respect to the threatened action.",wiki
"Edwards v.

Statements obtained in violation of this rule are a violation of a defendant's Fifth Amendment rights.

United States which stipulates that the right to counsel can only be legally asserted by an ""unambiguous or unequivocal request for counsel.""",wiki

The Court reasoned that while luggage is movable like an automobile, it does not have the lesser expectation of privacy associated with an automobile.
Chadwick was later abrogated on other grounds by California v. Acevedo (1991), in which the Court overruled Chadwick's holding with respect to containers within a vehicle, holding that police may search a container within a vehicle without a warrant if they have probable cause to believe that the container itself holds contraband or evidence.

Colorado, 338 U.S. 25 (1949), was a United States Supreme Court case in which the Court held 6—3 that, while the Fourth Amendment was applicable to the states, the exclusionary rule was not a necessary ingredient of the Fourth Amendment's right against warrantless and unreasonable searches and seizures. In Weeks v. United States, 232 U.S. 383 (1914), the Court held that as a matter of judicial implication the exclusionary rule was enforceable in federal courts but not derived from the explicit requirements of the Fourth Amendment. The Wolf Court decided not to incorporate the exclusionary rule as part of the Fourteenth Amendment in large part because the states which had rejected the Weeks Doctrine (the exclusionary rule) had not left the right to privacy without other means of protection (i.e. the States had their own rules to deter police officers from conducting warrantless and unreasonable searches and seizures). However, because most of the states' rules proved to be ineffective in deterrence, the Court overruled Wolf in Mapp v. Ohio, 367 U.S. 643 (1961).

On August 17, 1979, suspected drug trafficker Raymond Place had his luggage seized at LaGuardia Airport by agents with the Drug Enforcement Administration, which they kept for several days and exposed to a drug-sniffing dog without a search warrant. Justice Sandra Day O'Connor wrote for the unanimous Court that the sniff of a dog is sui generis, or ""uniquely pervasive"", and thus police do not need probable cause for their dogs to sniff a person's belongings in a public place. The Court did rule, however, that detaining a person's belongings while waiting for a police dog to arrive did constitute a ""seizure"" under the Fourth Amendment.
The decision was the first case to uphold the constitutionality of police use of drug-sniffing dogs, and the Court would revisit the decision several times in the following decades. In Illinois v. Caballes (2005), the Court held that it did not violate the Fourth Amendment to use a drug-detection dog during a legal traffic stop, as long as it did not unreasonably prolong the duration of it. In 2013, the Court held that the police may not bring a police dog to the front door of a private residence without reasonable suspicion (Florida v.

It is most known for giving a legal basis to some degree that forms of hate speech that may be deemed to breach US libel law are not protected by the First Amendment.
The petitioner, Joseph Beauharnais, who served as the president of the White Circle League of America, a white supremacist group, had distributed a leaflet ""setting forth a petition calling on the Mayor and City Council of Chicago 'to halt the further encroachment, harassment and invasion of white people, their property, neighborhoods and persons, by the Negro.'""

By a 6-to-3 vote, however, the court held that the officer in this case had gone beyond the limits of a lawful patdown search before he could determine that the object was contraband, making the search and the subsequent seizure unlawful under the Fourth Amendment.

"United States v. Shabani, 513 U.S. 10 (1994), was a court case in which the Supreme Court of the United States clarified standards for conspiracy liability under a federal drug conspiracy statute. In a unanimous opinion written by Justice Sandra Day O'Connor, the Court held that government prosecutors need not prove evidence of an overt act in furtherance of the conspiracy when prosecuting individuals under the drug conspiracy statute codified at 21 U.S.C. § 846. Justice O'Connor wrote that Congress intended to ""adopt the common law definition"" of conspiracy for section 846, which did not require an overt act as a precondition of liability. Justice O'Connor's opinion also compared the drug conspiracy statute to the general conspiracy statute, which requires that a conspirator commit an overt act in furtherance of the conspiracy, noting that ""[i]n light of this additional element in the general conspiracy statute, Congress' silence in § 846 speaks volumes.""",wiki
"Heller v. New York, 413 U.S. 483 (1973), was a United States Supreme Court decision which upheld that states could make laws limiting the distribution of obscene material, provided that these laws were consistent with the Miller test for obscene material established by the Supreme Court in Miller v. California, 413 U.S. 15 (1973). Heller was initially convicted for showing a sexually explicit film in the movie theater which he owned, under New York Penal Law § 235.0 which stated that and individual “is guilty of obscenity when, knowing its content and character, he 1. Promotes, or possesses with intent to promote, any obscene material; or 2. Produces, presents or directs an obscene performance or participates in a portion thereof which is obscene or which contributes to its obscenity.""
Heller appealed this ruling to the supreme court, claiming that his first amendment rights had been violated due to the broad nature of New York's obscenity laws. The defendant also claimed that his 14th amendment rights had been violated due to the fact the film was seized prior to him receiving a hearing of any kind. The Supreme Court ruled in favor of Heller in a 5–4 decision, with the majority decision delivered by Justice Burger. The Court found the procedure by which the film was seized to be constitutional but ruled in favor of Heller in order to afford New York a chance to bring their obscenity laws in line with the guidelines established by the Supreme Court in Miller v. California]]. The dissenting opinions were written by Justices William O. Douglas and William J. Brennan Jr., the latter of which was joined by Justices Potter Stewart and Thurgood Marshall. These dissenting opinions argued that the obscenity laws that Heller was convicted under were themselves unconstitutional and thus the seizure of the film was unconstitutional. This case was one of several cases that the Burger court ruled on concerning obscenity laws in the early 1970s.",wiki

"Sony Corp. of America v. Universal City Studios, Inc., 464 U.S. 417 (1984), also known as the ""Betamax case"", is a decision by the Supreme Court of the United States which ruled that the making of individual copies of complete television shows for purposes of time shifting does not constitute copyright infringement, but can instead be defended as fair use. The court also ruled that the manufacturers of home video recording devices, such as Betamax or other VCRs (referred to as VTRs in the case), cannot be liable for contributory infringement. The case was a boon to the home video market, as it created a legal safe harbor for the technology.
The broader legal consequence of the Supreme Court's decision was its establishment of a general test for determining whether a device with copying or recording capabilities ran afoul of copyright law. This test has created some interpretative challenges for courts when applying the precedent to more recent file sharing technologies available for use on home computers and over the Internet.",wiki

"Mandoli v. Acheson, 344 U.S. 133 (1952), was a United States Supreme Court case in which the Court held that a person born in the United States, with both U.S. citizenship and a foreign citizenship obtained via an alien parent or parents, does not need to live in or return to the United States as an adult in order to retain U.S. citizenship.
The citizenship status of Joseph Mandoli, a man born in the U.S. to Italian parents who took him as a baby to live with them in Italy, was challenged on several grounds, including primarily the fact that he had remained in Italy as an adult and had not returned to live in the United States upon reaching adulthood. Lower courts had rejected Mandoli's claim to U.S. citizenship on the basis of a 1939 Supreme Court case, Perkins v. Elg, which had suggested that a person born in the U.S. with both U.S. and foreign citizenship needed to affirmatively choose U.S. citizenship (by returning to and establishing residence in the U.S.) as an adult, but the Court rejected this interpretation in the Mandoli case.
Mandoli's claim to U.S. citizenship was originally also challenged because he had served in the Italian armed forces and sworn an oath of allegiance to the Italian king while living in Italy. However, the government dropped these reasons on appeal, apparently because it was considered likely that Mandoli had not performed these actions voluntarily, as the conscription laws under the Benito Mussolini government in Italy would have made it effectively impossible for Mandoli to avoid military service.",wiki

The case was later distinguished by Garcetti v. Ceballos, where the Court held that statements by public employees made pursuant to their employment have no First Amendment protection.
Pickering involved a Township High School teacher who was dismissed after writing a letter to a local newspaper which criticised how the Township Board of Education and the district superintendent had handled past proposals to raise new revenue for the schools.  The claim that his writing the letter was protected by the First and Fourteenth Amendments was rejected by the Board of Education.

The Court approached the search from four views: automobile search, administrative inspection, heavily regulated industry inspection, and border search. As to the validity of the search under the automobile exception, the Court found no justification for the search under the Carroll doctrine because there was no probable cause. As to the validity of the search under various administrative inspection doctrines, the Court found that the officers lacked an area warrant. As to the validity of the heavily regulated industry inspection, the Court found that the doctrine is not applicable to traveling on a state highway.  As to the validity of a border search, the Court found that the site of the stop and the entirety of the road on which the stop occurred was too far from the border to be considered a border search.",wiki

"Arnett v. Kennedy, 416 U.S. 134 (1974), was a United States Supreme Court case in which the Court rejected a nonprobationary federal civil service employee's claim to a full hearing prior to dismissal over charges he had brought the government into disrepute by recklessly accusing a superior of corruption. The governing federal law prescribed not only grounds for removal but also removal procedures. The employee could only be removed for ""cause,"" but the procedures did not provide for an adversarial hearing prior to termination. The Court also rejected the respondent's claim that his First Amendment rights were violated.
The 6–3 decision was widely criticized by legal scholars for Justice William Rehnquist's controversial conceptualization of Kennedy's due process rights in his plurality opinion, joined by only two other justices and explicitly rejected by the others. Rehnquist reasoned that since the state creates property interests such as that Arnett held in his job through its statutes, any procedures the state creates to allow an employee to appeal a termination are thus sufficient to constitute due process. Thus, he wrote, those with such interests ""must take the bitter with the sweet"".
Justices Byron White and Thurgood Marshall disapprovingly quoted that line in their separate opinions (White concurring that Kennedy's First Amendment rights had not been violated but dissenting from the rest of the holding, while Marshall dissented entirely, joined by two other justices). Justice Lewis Powell, concurring with another justice, also rejected Rehnquist's theory. A later case, Logan v. Zimmerman Brush Co., held differently without explicitly overruling Arnett; in 1985's Cleveland Board of Education v. Loudermill, the Court held that public employees are entitled to some form of hearing before dismissal and formally rejected his ""bitter with the sweet"" formulation, with Rehnquist (by then Chief Justice) as the only dissenter. Some legal scholars have argued it should have been retained, or that the Court's subsequent disinterest in engaging this question has been to the detriment of its jurisprudence.
The First Amendment aspect of the holding—that the FFLA's provisions that covered employees could only be dismissed for ""such cause as will promote the efficiency of the service"" was neither overbroad nor so vague that employees lacked notice that speech such as Arnett's could lead to discipline—remains, although it has not been relied on much. After the case was remanded to the district court, Kennedy was again fired. He appealed that to the federal Civil Service Commission and was reinstated with back pay within a year.

"Motor Vehicle Manufacturers Association v. State Farm Mutual Automobile Insurance Co., 463 U.S. 29 (1983), commonly known in U.S. administrative law as State Farm, is a United States Supreme Court decision concerning regulations requiring passive restraints in cars. Decided in 1983, one year before Chevron U.S.A., Inc. v. Natural Resources Defense Council, Inc.,  the Court found that the National Highway Traffic Safety Administration had not provided a ""reasoned analysis"" for rescinding regulations that required either airbags or automatic seat belts in new cars.
It held that the arbitrary and capricious standard for reviewing agency action to enact regulations also applied to changing regulations. It held the rescinding the standard was arbitrary and capricious because the NHTSA did not provide evidence for the decision for two reasons: 1) The agency did not consider alternatives like requiring all cars to have airbags 2) The agency did not provide any evidence for its findings that automatic seat belts would not increase seat belt usage, even though the record evidence included surveys of drivers showing that seat belt usage more than doubled over manual seat belts.

"Washington v. Texas, 388 U.S. 14 (1967), is a United States Supreme Court case in which the Court decided that the Compulsory Process Clause of the Sixth Amendment to the Constitution (guaranteeing the right of a criminal defendant to force the attendance of witnesses for their side) is applicable in state courts as well as federal courts. Jackie Washington had attempted to call his co-defendant as a witness, but was blocked by Texas courts because state law prevented co-defendants from testifying for each other, under the theory that they would be likely to lie for each other on the stand.
The Supreme Court reasoned that the Due Process Clause of the Fourteenth Amendment made the right to be able to compel defense witnesses to testify necessary for a defendant's ""due process"" rights to fair proceedings, which applies to the states. Only Justice John Marshall Harlan II parted from the Court's ""due process"" focus, though he agreed with the outcome, as he regularly did in cases involving whether to apply federal rights to state courts.
The impact of Washington was narrowed by a later case, Taylor v. Illinois (1988), in which the Court said that ""countervailing public interests"", like the need to move through cases quickly, could be balanced against a defendant's right to present witnesses. In Taylor, the Supreme Court upheld a judge's order blocking defense witnesses from testifying due to the defense attorney's deliberate failure to disclose evidence to prosecutors earlier in the trial. The defense attorney's actions resulted in a lengthy delay in the proceedings which the trial judge felt was unjustified. Legal scholars have seen this new grant of discretion to trial judges as a change to relying on ""efficient justice"", a more limited vision of trial rights than the ""right to present a defense"" created in Washington.",wiki

"Gonzales v. Carhart, 550 U.S. 124 (2007), was a landmark decision of the U.S. Supreme Court that upheld the Partial-Birth Abortion Ban Act of 2003. The case reached the high court after U.S. Attorney General, Alberto Gonzales, appealed a ruling of the U.S. Court of Appeals for the Eighth Circuit in favor of LeRoy Carhart that struck down the Act. Also before the Supreme Court was the consolidated appeal of Gonzales v. Planned Parenthood from the U.S. Court of Appeals for the Ninth Circuit, whose ruling had the same effect as that of the Eighth Circuit.
The Supreme Court's decision upheld Congress's ban and held that it did not impose an undue burden on the due process right of women to obtain an abortion, ""under precedents we here assume to be controlling"", such as the Court's prior decisions in Roe v. Wade and Planned Parenthood v. Casey. In a legal sense, the case distinguished but did not overrule Stenberg v. Carhart (2000), in which the Court dealt with related issues. Gonzales was widely interpreted as signaling a shift in Supreme Court jurisprudence toward a restriction of abortion rights, occasioned in part by the retirement of Sandra Day O'Connor and her replacement by Samuel Alito.
The Court found that there is ""uncertainty [in the medical community] over whether the barred procedure is ever necessary to preserve a woman's health"", and in the past the Court ""has given state and federal legislatures wide discretion to pass legislation in areas where there is medical and scientific uncertainty.""",wiki

"Central Bank of Denver v. First Interstate Bank of Denver, 511 U.S. 164 (1994), was a decision by the United States Supreme Court, which held private plaintiffs may not maintain aiding and abetting suits under Securities Exchange Act § 10(b).
The majority opinion in the case established that liability did not extend to ""aiders or abettors"" that participate in misstatements or omissions in connection with the sale of securities. The Supreme Court held that ""private civil liability under Rule 10b-5 does not extend to those who do not engage in a manipulative or deceptive practice but who aid and abet such a violation of 10(b)."" This distinguished between the primary liability of violators of Rule 10b-5 and non-primary defendants, who had not directly deceived investors. This was a more literal reading than hitherto of Section 10(b) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 and the Securities and Exchange Commission's Rule 10b-5, which prohibit fraud or deceit in connection with the purchase or sale of securities.
The Supreme Court's ruling reversed a long history of court decisions and SEC enforcement actions where aiders and abettors, often banks, accountants, trustees, and attorneys, were found liable under Rule 10b-5. The case makes the distinction between primary violators, who directly misstate or omit material facts that are relied upon by investors, and aiders and abettors. According to the court:  ""A plaintiff must show reliance on the defendant's misstatement or omission to recover under 10b-5. Basic Inc. v. Levinson, supra, at 243. Were we to allow the aiding and abetting action proposed in this case, the defendant could be liable without any showing that the plaintiff relied upon the aider and abettor's statement or actions. . . ."".  When investors relied on such statements or actions, the court extends Rule 10b-5 liability to these secondary participants. The Court stated that ""any person or entity, including a lawyer, accountant, or bank, who employs a manipulative device or makes a material misstatement (or omission) on which a purchaser or seller of securities relies may be liable as a primary violator under 10b-5. . ..""

"Ward v. Rock Against Racism, 491 U.S. 781 (1989), was a United States Supreme Court case.

The Court found that the city had a substantial interest in limiting excessive noise and the regulation was ""content neutral."" The court found that ""narrow tailoring"" would be satisfied if the regulation promoted a substantial government interest that would be achieved less effectively without the regulation.
Justices Marshall, Brennan, and Stevens dissented.
In his dissent, Marshall agreed with the majority that the government has a substantial interest in controlling noise but believed that it may not advance that interest by actually asserting control over the amplification equipment and thus over private expression itself. The government has an obligation to adopt the least intrusive restriction necessary to achieve its goals such as enforcing the noise ordinance that has already been adopted.",wiki

"Wilko v. Swan, 346 U.S. 427 (1953), is a United States Supreme Court decision on the arbitration of securities fraud claims. It had originally been brought by an investor who claimed his broker at Hayden Stone had sold stock to him without disclosing that he and the firm were the primary sellers. By a 7–2 margin the Court held that the provisions of the Securities Act of 1933 barring any waiver of rights under that statute took precedence over the Federal Arbitration Act's (FAA) requirement that arbitration clauses in contracts be given full effect by federal courts. It reversed a decision to the contrary by a divided panel of the Second Circuit Court of Appeals.
Justice Stanley Forman Reed wrote the majority opinion that relied on the explicit wording in the Securities Act and expressed doubt as to whether arbitration could truly protect the rights of investors. Robert H. Jackson wrote a short concurrence distancing himself slightly from that latter opinion. Felix Frankfurter dissented, taking issue with the majority's hostility to arbitration.
Later the logic of the decision was extended by an appeals court to cover claims made under the Securities Exchange Act of 1934. The Supreme Court itself later expressed doubt as to the legal soundness of that holding, and in the 1985 case Shearson/American Express Inc. v. McMahon expressly held that it did not. This led lower courts to begin to overrule Wilko as well, and in 1989 the Court itself did so in Rodriguez de Quijas v. Shearson/American Express Inc., part of a series of decisions in the 1980s and ever since that greatly expanded the use of arbitration in dispute resolution.
Although the decision was overruled, one aspect of it survived Rodriguez de Quijas: Reed's dictum that ""manifest disregard"" for the law would be enough to justify a court's overturning an arbitral award. Later courts and commentators have puzzled over what that meant and whether it arose from the text of the FAA or independently. The Court itself would face that question in the 2008 Hall Street Associates, L.L.C. v. Mattel, Inc., although without resolving it to much satisfaction.",wiki

"County of Allegheny v. American Civil Liberties Union, 492 U.S. 573 (1989), was a United States Supreme Court case in which the Court considered the constitutionality of two recurring Christmas and Hanukkah holiday displays located on public property in downtown Pittsburgh. The first, a nativity scene (crèche), was placed on the grand staircase of the Allegheny County Courthouse. The second of the holiday display in question was an 18-foot (5.5 m) public Hanukkah menorah, which was placed just outside the City-County Building next to the city's 45-foot (14 m) decorated Christmas tree and a sign saluting liberty. The legality of the Christmas tree display was not considered in this case.
In a complex and fragmented decision, the majority held that the County of Allegheny violated the Establishment Clause by displaying a crèche in the county courthouse, because the ""principal or primary effect"" of the display was to advance religion within the meaning of Lemon v. Kurtzman (1971), when viewed in its overall context. Moreover, in contrast to Lynch v. Donnelly (1984), nothing in the crèche's setting detracted from that message.
A different majority held that the menorah display did not have the prohibited effect of endorsing religion, given its ""particular physical setting"". Its combined display with a Christmas tree and a sign saluting liberty did not impermissibly endorse both the Christian and Jewish faiths, but simply recognized that both Christmas and Hanukkah are part of the same winter-holiday season, which, the Court found, had attained a secular status in U.S. society.",wiki

"Bivens v. Six Unknown Named Agents, 403 U.S. 388 (1971), was a case in which the US Supreme Court ruled that an implied cause of action existed for an individual whose Fourth Amendment protection against unreasonable search and seizures had been violated by the Federal Bureau of Narcotics.[1] The victim of such a deprivation could sue for the violation of the Fourth Amendment itself despite the lack of any federal statute authorizing such a suit. The existence of a remedy for the violation was implied by the importance of the right violated.
The case was understood to create a cause of action against the federal government similar to the one in 42 U.S.C. § 1983 against the states. However, the Supreme Court has sharply limited new Bivens claims.
The Supreme Court has upheld Bivens claims only three times: in Bivens (1971), Davis v. Passman (1979), and Carlson v. Green (1980). Under Ziglar v. Abbasi (2017) and Egbert v. Boule (2022), any claim that is not highly similar to the facts in Bivens (excessive force during arrest), Davis (sex discrimination in federal employment), or Carlson (inadequate care in prison) is a ""new context"" to which Bivens will not be extended if ""there is any reason to think that Congress might be better equipped to create a damages remedy.""",wiki

"Givhan v. Western Line Consolidated School District, 439 U.S. 410 (1979), is a United States Supreme Court decision on the free speech rights of public employees. The Court held unanimously in favor of a schoolteacher fired for her critical remarks in conversations with her principal. Justice William Rehnquist wrote the opinion, with a short concurrence by John Paul Stevens.
The petitioner, Bessie Givhan, had believed that various policies and practices of the newly integrated Western Line School District in Mississippi were meant to sustain school segregation. In private meetings with her new principal, she persistently complained about this. The principal in turn recommended the district not rehire her, citing those conversations as well as some other issues. She joined the ongoing desegregation lawsuit as an intervenor, alleging that her First and Fourteenth Amendment rights to free speech and due process had been violated. The district court hearing the case agreed, but then the Fifth Circuit reversed that decision, holding that since she had not spoken publicly she was not entitled to constitutional protection, distinguishing her case from two other recent decisions in which the Supreme Court had ruled in favor of non-tenured teachers let go by their districts following critical statements by noting that in those cases, the criticism had been expressed in a public context.
Rehnquist's opinion rejected that distinction, calling the Fifth Circuit's reading too narrow. He further rejected its claim that Givhan had forced herself on an unwilling listener, since the principal had invited her in. Since the district had cited other, potentially permissible reasons for its action, the Court remanded the case to the district court to apply the Mt. Healthy test, from one of the other two cases involving teachers, and determine if the district had adequate reason to fire her other than the speech. Three years later, the lower court found that it did not, and ordered Givhan reinstated after a 12-year absence.
The Court has not had to significantly revisit the holding since then, and it has not been subject to much commentary or legal analysis. Four years later, in Connick v. Myers, its next case on the free speech rights of public employees, it began to limit Givhan and its predecessors by sketching out a test for whether the employee's speech was on a matter of public concern. In the early 21st century, its holding in Garcetti v. Ceballos, that speech made by employees pursuant to their job duties was not protected, appeared to some to complicate Givhan although the Court said it would not.",wiki

Lead plaintiff Betty Dukes, a Walmart employee, and others alleged gender discrimination in pay and promotion policies and practices in Walmart stores.
The Court agreed to hear argument on whether Federal Rule of Civil Procedure, Rule 23(b)(2), which provides for class-actions if the defendant's actions make injunctive relief appropriate, can be used to file a class action that demands monetary damages. The Court also asked the parties to argue whether the class meets the traditional requirements of numerosity, commonality, typicality, and adequacy of representation.

"Whalen v. Roe, 429 U.S. 589 (1977), was a case brought before the Supreme Court of the United States.  The case involved a New York state prescription monitoring law requiring reporting and storing of information concerning all Schedule II drug prescriptions.  Physicians were required to report the name of the prescribing physician; the dispensing pharmacy; the drug and dosage; and the patient's name, address, and age. This information was then stored by the New York Department of State.
A group of patients, several doctors who prescribe such drugs, and two associations of physicians brought suit against the New York State Department of Health commissioner, seeking to enjoin the State from enforcing the Act.
A three-judge panel of the United States District Court for the Southern District of New York, held the statutes unconstitutional and enjoined  enforcement of the challenged provisions.

"Smiley v. Citibank, 517 U.S. 735 (1996), is a U.S. Supreme Court decision upholding a regulation of the Comptroller of Currency which included credit card late fees and other penalties within the definition of interest and thus prevented individual states from limiting them when charged by nationally-chartered banks. Justice Antonin Scalia wrote for a unanimous court that the regulation was reasonable enough under the Court's own Chevron standard for the justices to defer to the Comptroller.
The decision, which had begun as a class action in California, was seen as a victory for banks and credit-card issuers, who could mostly charge late fees as they pleased. For that same reason consumer advocates were displeased, warning that late fees could rise to previously unseen levels. They did, and one of the Citibank attorneys has expressed regret for his involvement.",wiki

"First National Bank of Boston v. Bellotti, 435 U.S. 765 (1978), is a U.S. constitutional law case which defined the free speech right of corporations for the first time. The United States Supreme Court held that corporations have a First Amendment right to make contributions to ballot initiative campaigns.  The ruling came in response to a Massachusetts law that prohibited corporate donations in ballot initiatives unless the corporation's interests were directly involved.
In 1976 several corporations, including the First National Bank of Boston, were barred from contributing to a Massachusetts referendum regarding tax policy and subsequently sued. The case was successfully appealed to the Supreme Court, which heard oral arguments in November 1977. On April 26, 1978, the Court ruled 5–4 against the Massachusetts law.
As a result of the ruling, states could no longer impose specific regulations on donations from corporations in ballot initiative campaigns.

"Shearson/American Express Inc. v. McMahon, 482 U.S. 220 (1987), is a United States Supreme Court decision concerning arbitration of private securities fraud claims arising under the Securities Exchange Act of 1934. By a 5–4 margin the Court held that its holding in a 1953 case, Wilko v. Swan, that the nonwaiver provisions of the Securities Act of 1933 prevented the mandatory arbitration of such claims, did not apply to claims under the 1934 Act due to differences in the corresponding language of the two statutes, reversing a decision of the Second Circuit Court of Appeals that had affirmed what had been considered settled law, despite the lack of a precedent. It likewise held that claims under the Racketeer Influenced and Corrupt Organizations Act (RICO) were arbitrable, affirming an order from the district court that the Second Circuit had also upheld.
The question of whether claims under the 1934 Act were likewise exempt from the Federal Arbitration Act had first been raised in a 1974 case, Scherk v. Alberto-Culver Inc.. At that time Potter Stewart had found them not relevant to the case and upheld the arbitration order on the grounds that the case involved an international dispute. They had resurfaced in the previous term, in Justice Byron White's concurrence in Dean Witter Reynolds Inc. v. Byrd. Lower courts began embracing White's analysis, eventually creating a conflict in the circuits on appeal.
Justice Sandra Day O'Connor wrote the majority opinion, reiterating  and deepening White's analysis. Harry Blackmun dissented for himself and justices Brennan and Marshall, who had written for a unanimous Court in Byrd. John Paul Stevens wrote a separate dissent. Both of those dissents concurred in the holding that the RICO claims were arbitrable. On remand, the case remained unresolved for another three years. The district judge fined the McMahons' counsel for filing frivolous motions, sanctions which were reversed on appeal, setting another precedent.
McMahon greatly expanded the use of arbitration in securities disputes, since many of them take place under the 1934 Act, which regulates the secondary market in which most investors trade. It also signaled a greater acceptance of arbitration as a desirable and fair method of dispute resolution. This was cited by the Court three years later in Rodriguez de Quijas v. Shearson/American Express Inc., when it overturned Wilko completely and held that claims under the 1933 Act could also be arbitrated if the parties had clearly chosen to do so. The expansion in securities arbitration as a result led to reforms during the 1990s to make the process more investor-friendly.",wiki

"Snyder v. Phelps, 562 U.S. 443 (2011), is a landmark decision by the Supreme Court of the United States in which the Court held that speech made in a public place on a matter of public concern cannot be the basis of liability for a tort of emotional distress, even if the speech is viewed as offensive or outrageous.
On March 10, 2006, seven members of the Westboro Baptist Church (WBC), led by the church's founder Fred Phelps, picketed the funeral of U.S. Marine Matthew Snyder, who was killed in a non-combat accident during the Iraq War. On public land about 1,000 feet from where the funeral was being held, protesters displayed placards that read ""Thank God for Dead Soldiers"", ""God Hates Fags"", and ""You're Going to Hell"", among others. Snyder's father, Albert Snyder, filed a lawsuit seeking damages from Phelps and the Westboro Baptist Church, claiming that their picketing was meant to intentionally inflict emotional distress. Phelps defended the picketing as an appropriate use of their right to free speech and right to peacefully protest as protected by the First Amendment to the U.S. Constitution.
The District Court of Maryland ruled in Snyder's favor and awarded him a total of $10.9 million in damages, but the Fourth Circuit Court of Appeals reversed, holding that the protesters' signs were ""rhetorical hyperbole"" and ""figurative expression"" and were therefore protected speech under the First Amendment. On appeal to the U.S. Supreme Court, the Court ruled in favor of Phelps, holding that speech made in a public place on a matter of public concern cannot be the basis for a claim of tort liability for intentional infliction of emotional distress. In an 8–1 decision delivered by Chief Justice John Roberts, the Court wrote that the First Amendment ""shield[s] Westboro from tort liability for its picketing"" because the speech was made on a matter of public concern and did not disrupt the funeral. The First Amendment provides special protection to public issues because it serves ""the principle that debate on public issues should be uninhibited, robust, and wide-open.""",wiki

"Oregon v. Ice, 555 U.S. 160 (2009), was a legal case in which the Supreme Court of the United States held that the Sixth Amendment to the United States Constitution  does not inhibit states from assigning to judges, rather than juries, the finding of facts necessary to the imposition of consecutive, rather than concurrent, sentences for multiple offenses.[1]
Ice, a supervisor of an apartment complex, twice entered a residence and, on each occasion, touched the breasts and vagina of an 11-year-old girl.  For each incident, a jury found him guilty of first-degree burglary for entering with the intent to commit sexual assault, as well as two counts of sexual abuse.
The statute under which Ice was sentenced, Oregon Revised Statutes 137.123, generally provided for concurrent sentences. However, it allowed for consecutive sentencing when the offenses did not arise from the same course of conduct. The statute also allowed for such sentencing when the offense was indicative of a willingness to commit more than one offense, or the offense caused or created a risk of greater or qualitatively different harm to the victim.
The trial judge found that Ice's conduct satisfied these criteria and ordered that his sentences for the two burglaries and the two sexual assaults, in which he touched the girl's vagina, to be served consecutively. The judge allowed the two sexual assault sentences for touching the girl's breasts to be served concurrently. Thus, the judge's action nearly quadrupled his sentence from 7.5 years to over 28 years.

The petitioner's conviction was sustained in a 5–4 ruling, upholding a prior ruling in Barenblatt v. United States.
The petitioner was indeed summoned to testify before a Subcommittee of the House of Representatives' Un-American Activities Committee, which was investigating alleged Communist infiltration into basic industries and Communist Party propaganda activities. The petitioner refused to answer a question as to whether he was a member of the Communist Party, contending that the Subcommittee lacked legal authority to interrogate him and that its questioning violated his First Amendment rights. He was convicted of a misdemeanor violation of 2 U.S.C. § 192. The Court also, on February 27, 1961, denied Braden v. United States, a companion case appealing a similar 2 U.S.C. § 192 conviction.

The NCAA is an organization that regulates college athletics, and membership is voluntary, although NCAA schools are not allowed to play against non-NCAA teams. The case dealt with television rights to college football games, which were controlled by the NCAA and limited the appearance of university teams in each season.

"Green v. County School Board of New Kent County, 391 U.S. 430 (1968), was an important United States Supreme Court case involving school desegregation. Specifically, the Court dealt with the freedom of choice plans created to avoid compliance with the Supreme Court's mandate in Brown II in 1955. The Court held unanimously that New Kent County's freedom of choice plan did not adequately comply with the school board's responsibility to determine a system of admission to public schools on a non-racial basis. The Supreme Court mandated that the school board must formulate new plans and steps towards realistically converting to a desegregated system. Green v. County School Board of New Kent County was a follow-up of Brown v. Board of Education.
“When this opinion is handed down, the traffic light will have changed from Brown to Green.” –U.S. Supreme Court Justice William Brennan, 1968.

"Coeur Alaska, Inc. v. Southeast Alaska Conservation Council, 557 U.S. 261 (2009), is a United States Supreme Court case that was decided in favor of Coeur Alaska's permit to dump mine waste in a lake. The case addressed tailings from the Kensington mine, an underground mine located  in Alaska. The gold mine had not operated since 1928, and Coeur Alaska obtained a permit in 2005 from the United States Army Corps of Engineers (USACE) to dispose of up to 4.5 million tons of tailings in Lower Slate Lake, which is located in a National Forest.
The suit was filed by three environmental non-governmental organizations and brought before the United States District Court for the District of Alaska who found in favor of Coeur Alaska.  The District Court's decision was overturned by the U.S. 9th Circuit Court of Appeals before being brought before the Supreme Court, who also found in favor of Coeur Alaska.
The ruling was praised by the National Mining Association for the economic benefit it provided.

Fordice, 505 U.S. 717 (1992), is a United States Supreme Court case that resulted in an eight to one ruling that the eight public universities in Mississippi had not sufficiently integrated and that the state must take affirmative action to change this under the Equal Protection Clause. The Court found that, although the state had eliminated explicit prohibitions on the admission of black students to institutions including the University of Mississippi, Mississippi State University, and the University of Southern Mississippi, the Court of Appeals had not properly reviewed the set of discriminatory policies used by the state to suppress black enrollment at these schools. On this point, the Court stated that ""[i]f the State perpetuates policies and practices traceable to its prior system that continue to have segregative effects – whether by influencing student enrollment decisions or by fostering segregation in other facets of the university system – and such policies are without sound educational justification and can be practicably eliminated, the State has not satisfied its burden of proving that it has dismantled its prior system.""
Four opinions were filed in the case. In addition to Justice White's majority opinion, Justice O'Connor and Justice Thomas filed concurring opinions. Thomas, in particular, expressed a concern that the strict review of policies that divided students by race should not be used against historically black universities in the state.

"Florida Lime & Avocado Growers, Inc. v. Paul, 373 U.S. 132 (1963), was a 1963 decision of the United States Supreme Court in which the Court declined to invalidate a California law that imposed minimum fat content standards on avocados sold in the state, including those imported from other states.  The law prohibited the sale of avocados that did not contain at least 8% oil by weight. Florida, a major avocado producer, employed, for wholesale marketing purposes, a federal standard unrelated to oil content.  Most Florida avocados that were marketable at home failed to meet the California standard, because they were a different variety from those sold in California, with a lower fat content. Accordingly, Florida avocado growers brought this suit, arguing (unsuccessfully) that the California law (1) was preempted by federal law, (2) violated equal protection, and (3) unduly burdened and interfered with their right to engage in interstate commerce. The case is widely used in law school casebooks on constitutional law and federal jurisdiction as illustrative of preemption issues.",wiki
"Taylor v. Illinois, 484 U.S. 400 (1988), is a United States Supreme Court decision in which the Court held that defense witnesses can be prevented from testifying under certain circumstances, even if that hurts the defense's case. Taylor was the first case to hold that there is no absolute bar to blocking the testimony of a surprise witness, even if that is an essential witness for the defendant, a limitation of the broad right to present a defense recognized in Washington v. Texas (1967).
Taylor was the first Compulsory Process Clause case since Washington v. Texas to provide a specific limitation on the right of defendants to force their witnesses to testify. In that case, the Court construed a defendant's right very broadly in his ability to present a defense. Here, however, the Court restricted that ability to comply with court rules, especially if those rules were of equal consequence upon both the prosecution and the defense. This decision was reached over the dissent of three Justices, all of whom felt a defendant's case should not be limited based on an error solely by the defendant's attorney to list appropriate witnesses.",wiki

"Brown v. Board of Education of Topeka, 347 U.S. 483 (1954), was a landmark decision of the U.S. Supreme Court ruling that U.S. state laws establishing racial segregation in public schools are unconstitutional, even if the segregated schools are otherwise equal in quality. The decision partially overruled the Court's 1896 decision Plessy v. Ferguson, which had held that racial segregation laws did not violate the U.S. Constitution as long as the facilities for each race were equal in quality, a doctrine that had come to be known as ""separate but equal"". The Court's unanimous decision in Brown, and its related cases, paved the way for integration and was a major victory of the civil rights movement, and a model for many future impact litigation cases.
The case began in 1951 when the public school system in Topeka, Kansas, refused to enroll the daughter of local black resident Oliver Brown at the school closest to their home, instead requiring her to ride a bus to a segregated black school farther away.  The Browns and twelve other local black families in similar situations filed a class-action lawsuit in U.S. federal court against the Topeka Board of Education, alleging its segregation policy was unconstitutional. A special three-judge court of the U.S. District Court for the District of Kansas heard the case and ruled against the Browns, relying on the precedent of Plessy and its ""separate but equal"" doctrine. The Browns, represented by NAACP chief counsel Thurgood Marshall, appealed the ruling directly to the Supreme Court.
In May 1954, the Supreme Court issued a unanimous 9–0 decision in favor of the Browns. The Court ruled that ""separate educational facilities are inherently unequal,"" and therefore laws that impose them violate the Equal Protection Clause of the Fourteenth Amendment of the U.S. Constitution. However, the decision's 14 pages did not spell out any sort of method for ending racial segregation in schools, and the Court's second decision in Brown II (1955) only ordered states to desegregate ""with all deliberate speed"".
In the Southern United States, the reaction to Brown among most white people was ""noisy and stubborn"", especially in the Deep South where racial segregation was deeply entrenched in society. Many Southern governmental and political leaders embraced a plan known as ""massive resistance"", created by Senator Harry F. Byrd, in order to frustrate attempts to force them to de-segregate their school systems. Four years later, in the case of Cooper v. Aaron, the Court reaffirmed its ruling in Brown, and explicitly stated that state officials and legislators had no power to nullify its ruling.",wiki

"Valley Forge Christian College v. Americans United for Separation of Church and State, 454 U.S. 464 (1982), was a decision by the Supreme Court of the United States in which the court refused to expand  the Flast v. Cohen exception to the taxpayer standing rule.
The Department of Health, Education, and Welfare had disposed of surplus property by conveying it, without charge, to a church-related college.
Plaintiffs sought standing as taxpayers, and alternatively as citizens, claiming that the conveyance of property injured their right to a government that does not establish a religion.
Justice Rehnquist, writing the majority opinion, upheld the Flast test for taxpayer standing, ruling that plaintiffs lacked standing as taxpayers because they did not challenge an exercise of the Spending Clause. He also rejected the theory of standing as citizens. He held that the court is not merely a forum for ""public grievances"" brought by ""concerned bystanders""; if it were, he reasoned, ""the concept of 'standing' would be quite unnecessary"".
Justice Brennan, in his dissent, criticized the general prohibition on taxpayer standing established by Frothingham v. Mellon, arguing that standing should not be denied ""simply because many people suffer the same injury"" or because the injury is indirect. Justice Stevens, in his dissent, called ""the difference between a disposition of funds pursuant to the Spending Clause and a disposition of realty pursuant to the Property Clause"", ""a tenuous distinction"".",wiki
"New Jersey v. T. L. O., 469 U.S. 325 (1985), is a landmark decision by the Supreme Court of the United States which established the standards by which a public school official can search a student in a school environment without a search warrant, and to what extent.
The case centered around a student at Piscataway High School in Middlesex County, New Jersey, known then only by her initials T. L. O., who was searched for contraband after she was caught smoking in a school bathroom. She was sent to the principal's office, where the assistant vice principal searched her purse and found marijuana, drug paraphernalia, and documentation of drug sales. She was suspended from the school and charged by police for the paraphernalia found in the search, but fought the charges on the basis that the search of her purse violated the Fourth Amendment's prohibition against unreasonable search and seizure.
The New Jersey Superior Court affirmed the constitutionality of the search, but the Supreme Court of New Jersey reversed, holding that the search of her purse was unreasonable. On appeal to the U.S. Supreme Court, the Court held that the Fourth Amendment applies to searches conducted by school officials in a school setting. However, school officials do not need to have probable cause nor obtain a warrant before searching a student. Instead, in order for a search to be justified, school officials must have ""reasonable suspicion"" that the student has violated either the law or school rules. In a 6–3 decision delivered by Justice Byron White, the Court ruled that the school's search of T. L. O.'s purse was constitutional, setting a new precedent for school searches and student privacy.

"Heckler v. Chaney, 470 U.S. 821 (1985), is a decision of the Supreme Court of the United States which held that a federal agency's decision to not take an enforcement action is presumptively unreviewable by the courts under section 701(a)(2) of the Administrative Procedure Act (APA). The case arose out of a group of death row inmates' petition to the Food and Drug Administration (FDA), seeking to have the agency thwart the state governments' plans to execute the inmates by lethal injection. The FDA declined to interfere, a decision the inmates appealed unsuccessfully to the District Court for the District of Columbia. On further review, the D.C. Circuit Court of Appeals held that the FDA's action was reviewable and that its denial was ""arbitrary and capricious"". The Supreme Court unanimously reversed the appeals court and declared in an 8–1 decision that agency nonenforcement decisions were presumptively unreviewable.
The case hinged on various interpretations of sections 706 and 701(a) of the APA. Section 706 makes agency actions reviewable and empowers courts to set them aside when they are found to be ""arbitrary, capricious, [or] an abuse of discretion"", while section 701(a) lists two exceptions to section 706, preventing review where it is prevented by another statute or ""committed to agency discretion by law"". These two exceptions, fairly similar in scope, raised questions for courts attempting to interpret them. In Citizens to Preserve Overton Park v. Volpe (1971), the court ruled that the section 701(a)(2) exemption applies only where ""statutes are drawn in such broad terms that in a given case there is no law to apply"" that might constrain the agency's discretion, a holding which provoked some criticism from lower courts and the wider legal community.
The D.C. Circuit Court of Appeals reacted to Overton Park by holding that practical considerations should be used in determining whether to grant review, rather than looking at the laws relevant to the agency in question – in Chaney, they did precisely this in overturning the district court. The Supreme Court overturned the appeals court's decision and upheld Overton Park's emphasis on statutory considerations, but the presumption of unreviewability it created in this case was largely based on practical factors rather than statutory factors. It reasoned that, in general, an agency's decision not to enforce does not easily lend itself to manageable standards of judicial review, likening such a decision to one a prosecutor might make. It highlighted, however, that the presumption of unreviewability can be rebutted where the plaintiffs provide a relevant statute (""law to apply"") that limits the discretion of the agency.
Justice William J. Brennan Jr. concurred with the majority and emphasized that the court was not closing off all avenues of review for nonenforcement decisions. Justice Thurgood Marshall concurred in the judgment only, criticizing the majority's decision to create a presumption of unreviewability and instead arguing that the FDA's decision should have been held to be reviewable and upheld on the merits. Lower courts largely accepted the ruling, albeit with varying interpretations of scope; the wider legal community criticized the majority's rationale for a presumption of unreviewability while agreeing with the result immediately concerning the inmates.",wiki

"County of Oneida v. Oneida Indian Nation of New York State, 470 U.S. 226 (1985), was a landmark United States Supreme Court case concerning aboriginal title in the United States. The case, sometimes referred to as Oneida II, was ""the first Indian land claim case won on the basis of the Nonintercourse Act.""
The Supreme Court held that Indian tribes have a common law cause of action for possessory land claims based upon aboriginal title, that the Nonintercourse Act did not preempt that cause of action, and that the cause of action was not barred by a statute of limitations, abatement, implicit federal ratification, or nonjusticiability. Four dissenting justices would have held for the counties on the defense of laches, a question which the majority did not reach, but expressed doubts about.
Furthermore, the Court held that, due to the Eleventh Amendment, federal courts could not exercise ancillary jurisdiction over cross-claims by counties against states. Although only two other justices agreed with the entirety of Justice Powell's majority opinion, Brennan and Marshall agreed with Parts I-IV and VI (the Oneida's claims against the counties) and Burger, White, and Rehnquist agreed with Part V (the counties claims against the state), thus forging separate majorities.
The case is often referred to as Oneida II because it is the second of three times the Oneida Indian Nation reached the Supreme Court in litigating its land rights claims. It followed Oneida Indian Nation of New York v. County of Oneida (Oneida I) (1974), holding that there was federal subject-matter jurisdiction, and was followed by City of Sherrill v.

"Flast v. Cohen, 392 U.S. 83 (1968), was a United States Supreme Court case holding that federal taxpayers have standing to seek relief from the courts for claims that federal tax money is being used for unconstitutional purposes in violation of the Establishment Clause of the First Amendment.
The Supreme Court decided in Frothingham v. Mellon (1923), that a taxpayer did not have standing to sue the federal government to prevent expenditures if his only injury is an anticipated increase in taxes. Frothingham v. Mellon did not recognize a constitutional barrier against federal taxpayer lawsuits. Rather, it denied standing because the petitioner did not allege ""a breach by Congress of the specific constitutional limitations imposed upon an exercise of the taxing and spending power."" Because the purpose of standing is to avoid burdening the court with situations in which there is no real controversy, standing is used to ensure that the parties in the suit are properly adversarial, ""not whether the issue itself is justiciable.""
In 1968, Florence Flast joined several others in filing a lawsuit against Wilbur Cohen, the Secretary of Health, Education, and Welfare, contending that spending funds on religious schools violated the First Amendment's ban on the establishment of religion.

"Aetna Health Inc. v. Davila, 542 U.S. 200 (2004), was a United States Supreme Court case in which the Court limited the scope of the Texas Healthcare Liability Act (THCLA). The effective result of this decision was that the THCLA, which held Case Management and Utilization Review decisions by Managed Care entities like CIGNA and Aetna to a legal duty of care according to the laws of The State of Texas could not be enforced in the case of Health Benefit plans provided through private employers, because the Texas statute allowed compensatory or punitive damages to redress losses or deter future transgressions, which were not available under ERISA § 1132. The ruling still allows the State of Texas to enforce the THCLA in the case of Government-sponsored (Medicare, Medicaid, Federal, State, Municipal Employee, etc., Church-sponsored, or Individual Health Plan Policies (High-deductible individual policies, self-pay, any insurance not subsidised by a Private Employer), which are saved from preemption by ERISA. The history that allows these Private and Self-Pay Insurance to be saved dates to the ""Interstate Commerce"" power that was given the federal Government by the Supreme Court. ERISA, enacted in 1974, relied on the ""Interstate Commerce"" rule to allow federal jurisdiction over private employers, based on the need of private employers to follow a single set of paperwork and rules for pensions and other employee benefit plans where employers had employees in multiple states. Except for private employer plans, insurance can be regulated by the individual states, and Managed Care entities making medical decisions can be held accountable for those decisions if negligence is involved, as allowed by the Texas Healthcare Liability Act.

"United States v. U.S. District Court, 407 U.S. 297 (1972), also known as the Keith Case, was a landmark United States Supreme Court decision that upheld, in a unanimous 8-0 ruling, the requirements of the Fourth Amendment in cases of domestic surveillance targeting a domestic threat.
The United States charged John Sinclair, Lawrence 'Pun' Plamondon, and John Forrest with conspiracy to destroy government property. One of the defendants, Lawrence 'Pun' Plamondon, was also charged with the dynamite bombing of an office of the Central Intelligence Agency in Ann Arbor, Michigan. The defendants were leaders of the radical White Panther Party. In response to a pretrial motion by the defense for disclosure of all electronic surveillance information, Nixon's attorney general, John Mitchell, claimed he authorized the wiretaps pursuant to Title III of the Omnibus Crime Control and Safe Streets Act of 1968 and was not required to disclose the sources. Though warrantless, the act allows for an exception to prevent the overthrow of the government and when ""any other clear and present danger to the structure or existence of the Government"" exists. The Government contended that since the defendants were members of a domestic organization attempting to subvert and destroy it, this case fell under the exception clause.
After reading the briefs and hearing oral arguments by constitutional law attorney Hugh M. ""Buck"" Davis, Judge Damon Keith of the United States District Court for the Eastern District of Michigan disagreed and ordered the Government to disclose all of the illegally intercepted conversations to the defendants. The Government appealed, filing a petition for a writ of mandamus with the Court of Appeals for the Sixth Circuit to set aside the order.

"Youngstown Sheet & Tube Co. v. Sawyer, 343 U.S. 579 (1952), also commonly referred to as the Steel Seizure Case or the Youngstown Steel case, was a landmark United States Supreme Court decision that limited the power of the president of the United States to seize private property. The case served as a check on the most far-reaching claims of executive power at the time and signaled the Court's increased willingness to intervene in political questions.
In the midst of the Korean War, the United Steel Workers of America threatened a strike—for higher wages—against the major steel producers in the United States. As President Harry S. Truman believed that a strike of any length would cause severe dislocations for defense contractors, Truman seized control of steel production facilities, keeping the current operating management of the companies in place to run the plants under federal direction. Though the steelworkers supported the move, the steel companies launched a legal challenge to the seizure on the grounds that the president lacked the power to seize private property without express authorization from Congress.
In his majority opinion, Associate Justice Hugo Black held that the president lacked the power to seize the steel mills in the absence of statutory authority conferred on him by Congress. Five other justices agreed with the outcome of the case but wrote concurring opinions; some of these justices argued that the president might have the power to seize property absent legislative authorization in more extreme circumstances. Justice Robert H. Jackson's concurring opinion laid out a tripartite framework of presidential power that would prove influential among legal scholars and others charged with assessing executive power. In his dissent, Chief Justice Fred Vinson argued that the president's action was necessary to preserve the status quo so that Congress could act in the future. Truman was stunned by the decision, but he immediately restored control of the steel mills to their owners.",wiki

"Schweiker v. Chilicky, 487 U.S. 412 (1988), was a United States Supreme Court decision that established limitations on implied causes of action. The Court determined that a cause of action would not be implied for the violation of rights where the U.S. Congress had already provided a remedy for the violation of rights at issue, even if the remedy was inadequate.
In this case, seriously disabled people were wrongfully being denied federal benefits (although, on appeal to an Administrative Law Judge, two-thirds had their payments restored). Although Congress provides for the return of back-pay, no provision is made for pain and suffering or other economic losses. The injured parties sued responsible agency personnel, under the theory that pursuant to Bivens v. Six Unknown Named Agents they could allege a private right of action for deprivation of due process.
The Court examined whether Congress intended a private right of action under these circumstances, and concluded that if Congress has created a meaningful remedy – even if it is incomplete – then no Bivens-type remedy is available. Special factors counseling hesitation included judicial deference to a combination of: 

some indication that Congress considered providing a cause of action, and chose not to; and
the design of some government program containing what Congress considers an adequate remedial mechanism.
Here Congress has provided a great deal of process, and some relief, and has been otherwise silent as to a remedy, which the Court found to be enough to foreclose a Bivens remedy.",wiki

President Richard Nixon had claimed executive authority to force the Times to suspend publication of classified information in its possession. The question before the court was whether the constitutional freedom of the press, guaranteed by the First Amendment, was subordinate to a claimed need of the executive branch of government to maintain the secrecy of information.

"Marquette Nat. Bank of Minneapolis v. First of Omaha Service Corp., 439 U.S. 299 (1978), is a unanimous U.S. Supreme Court decision holding that state anti-usury laws regulating interest rates cannot be enforced against nationally chartered banks based in other states. Justice William Brennan wrote that it was clearly the intent of Congress when it passed the National Banking Act that nationally chartered banks would be subject only to federal regulation by the Comptroller of Currency and the laws of the state in which they were chartered, and that only Congress or the appropriate state legislature could pass the laws regulating them.
The case has been called one of the most important of the late 20th century, since it freed nationally chartered banks to offer credit cards to anyone in the U.S. they deemed qualified, and more specifically because it allowed them to export credit card interest rates to states with stricter regulations, opening up a race between states in an effort to attract lending institutions to set up shop in their states and offer a wider variety of consumer credit products. Over the next decade, the states accelerated a process that had already begun of repealing or loosening their anti-usury laws, allowing state-chartered banks to compete more equally with national ones. As a result, the use of credit cards has vastly increased, and the mortgage industry soon followed suit.",wiki

"Berghuis v. Thompkins, 560 U.S. 370 (2010), is a landmark decision by the Supreme Court of the United States in which the Court considered the position of a suspect who understands their right to remain silent under Miranda v. Arizona and is aware that they have the right to remain silent, but does not explicitly invoke or waive the right.
The Court held that unless and until the suspect actually states that they are relying on their right(s), their subsequent voluntary statements may be used in court and police may continue to interact with (or question) them. The mere act of remaining silent is, on its own, insufficient to imply the suspect has invoked their rights. Furthermore, a voluntary reply even after lengthy silence can be construed as to implying a waiver.
The Court was split, 5–4. The dissent, authored by Justice Sonia Sotomayor, argued that Miranda and other previous cases had required a claimed waiver of a constitutional right to be shown more strongly, especially in light of a lengthy interrogation with a possible ""compelling influence"" during which the accused had remained almost entirely silent for almost 3 hours prior to the self-incriminating statement.
Many considered Berghuis a further erosion of Miranda and were concerned it was ""turning the clocks back"" on safeguards developed in previous cases. At least one scholar has argued that Thompkins effectively gutted Miranda. A common criticism about the opinion is that vulnerable citizens could now be placed under pressure and, despite having an understanding of their rights, could be more easily coerced in a manner prejudicial to their interests.",wiki
"Stewart v. United States, 366 U.S. 1 (1961), was a United States Supreme Court case in which the Court held that asking a criminal defendant whether he had testified in previous trials violated his Fifth Amendment rights.
Willie Lee Stewart had already been tried twice for murder and had not testified in either trial. During his third trial his defense was insanity and he chose to testify in his own defense. During his cross-examination, the prosecutor asked, ""This is the first time you have gone on the stand, isn't it, Willie?"", alluding to the fact that Stewart had not testified in his first two trials. Stewart's attorney objected and ultimately appealed Stewart's criminal conviction to the Supreme Court.
The Fifth Amendment provides a criminal defendant with a right to refuse to testify. Relying on that provision, the Court held that the prosecutor's question was unduly prejudicial and unconstitutional. The Court further held that the error was not harmless and remanded for a new trial.

"Upjohn Co. v. United States, 449 U.S. 383 (1981), was a Supreme Court case in which the Court held that a company (in this case, the Upjohn company) could invoke the attorney–client privilege to protect communications made between company lawyers and non-management employees. In doing so, the Court rejected the narrower control group test that had previously governed many organizational attorney–client privilege issues. Under the control group test, only employees who exercised direct control over the managerial decisions of the company were eligible to have their communications with corporate lawyers protected. The case also expanded the scope of the work-product doctrine.
While the Upjohn decision did not explicitly mention a warning procedure, the case gave rise to a procedure called an ""Upjohn warning"", in which a company's lawyer explains that the lawyer represents the company and not the individual employee with whom the lawyer is dealing. This is intended to ensure that the employee understands that the company can waive the attorney-client privilege at any time and disclose the contents of the conversation between the lawyer and the employee, even if the employee objects. In subsequent cases, failure to give an Upjohn warning has led to the employee being able to claim privilege over communications with company lawyers.",wiki

"Reynolds v. Sims, 377 U.S. 533 (1964), was a landmark United States Supreme Court case in which the Court ruled that the electoral districts of state legislative chambers must be roughly equal in population. Along with Baker v. Carr (1962) and Wesberry v. Sanders (1964), it was part of a series of Warren Court cases that applied the principle of ""one person, one vote"" to U.S. legislative bodies.
Prior to the case, numerous state legislative chambers had districts containing unequal populations; for example, in the Nevada Senate, the smallest district had 568 people, while the largest had approximately 127,000 people. Some states refused to engage in regular redistricting, while others enshrined county by county representation (like the U.S. constitution does with state by state representation) in their constitutions. The case of Reynolds v. Sims arose after voters in Birmingham, Alabama, challenged the apportionment of the Alabama Legislature; the Constitution of Alabama provided for one state senator per county regardless of population differences.
In a majority opinion joined by five other justices, Chief Justice Earl Warren ruled that the Fourteenth Amendment's Equal Protection Clause requires states to establish state legislative electoral districts roughly equal in population. Warren held that ""legislators represent people, not trees or acres. Legislators are elected by voters, not farms or cities or economic interests."" In his dissenting opinion, Associate Justice John Marshall Harlan II argued that the Equal Protection Clause was not designed to apply to voting rights. The decision had a major impact on state legislatures, as many states had to change their system of representation.",wiki

Since it presumed that Congress's failure to act in the years since Federal Baseball Club was an implicit expression of intent to keep baseball exempt from the Sherman Antitrust Act, it has been read as having done more to create that exemption than the older case. Two justices (Stanley Forman Reed and Harold Hitz Burton) dissented from the short, unsigned per curiam majority opinion, arguing MLB and its revenue sources had changed enough since 1922 that the logic of that case no longer applied.

"Mancusi v. DeForte, 392 U.S. 364 (1968), is a decision of the United States Supreme Court on privacy and the Fourth Amendment. It originated in the lower courts as United States ex rel. Frank DeForte, appellant v. Vincent R. Mancusi, Warden of Attica Prison, Attica, New York, appellee, a petition for a writ of habeas corpus by a prisoner who had exhausted all his state appeals. By a 6–3 margin the Court affirmed the United States Court of Appeals for the Second Circuit's reversal of a district court denial of the petition.
The prisoner, Frank DeForte, was one of several labor union officials on Long Island who had been convicted of racketeering-related charges connected to a scheme in which they attempted to monopolize the jukebox market in the New York Metropolitan area. Early in the investigation, local prosecutors had issued a subpoena duces tecum for records from the union officials. When they refused to comply, the prosecutors went to the union offices themselves and seized the records from the officials' desks themselves. DeForte had been present and voiced his objections. The state later admitted the action was illegal but the documents, which formed the bulk of the case against the officials, were not suppressed at trial. Both the state's appellate court and the New York State Court of Appeals sustained the verdict, and all the defendants went to prison. There they began filing habeas petitions to the federal courts. The first, alleging that the court's orders to the jury to continue deliberating after they had done so for almost 24 hours and twice asked for a break constituted coercion, was denied.
DeForte's second, arguing as he had at trial and on his state appeal, that the search of his desk violated his reasonable expectation of privacy and thus his Fourth Amendment rights, was the one the Supreme Court heard. Justice John Marshall Harlan II wrote for the majority that under the Court's recent holding in Katz v. United States, DeForte had a reasonable expectation of privacy over the papers he kept at work even though they were not his personal property and he shared the office with his co-defendants. Nor did the subpoena authorize the prosecutor to act as he might with a search warrant, since the subpoena was not subject to independent judicial review before its execution. In dissent, Hugo Black, who had also dissented in Katz, said he could not find why the Court chose to depart from previous holdings that documents in the possession of one's employer enjoyed no Fourth Amendment protection, and was misreading the cases it relied on.
The case is seen as a seminal case in privacy law, since it extended it for the first time to a non-residential space. Lower courts have used it to guide them in distinguishing Fourth Amendment claims into the present day. The Supreme Court has, in later holdings, extended it to include public employees during administrative investigations and considered its application in the context of modern telecommunications.",wiki
"Roe v. Wade, 410 U.S. 113 (1973), was a landmark decision of the U.S. Supreme Court in which the Court ruled that the Constitution of the United States generally protected a right to have an abortion. The decision struck down many abortion laws, and caused an ongoing abortion debate in the United States about whether, or to what extent, abortion should be legal, who should decide the legality of abortion, and what the role of moral and religious views in the political sphere should be. The decision also shaped debate concerning which methods the Supreme Court should use in constitutional adjudication. The Supreme Court overruled Roe in 2022, ending the constitutional right to abortion.
The case was brought by Norma McCorvey—under the legal pseudonym ""Jane Roe""—who, in 1969, became pregnant with her third child. McCorvey wanted an abortion but lived in Texas, where abortion was illegal except when necessary to save the mother's life. Her lawyers, Sarah Weddington and Linda Coffee, filed a lawsuit on her behalf in U.S. federal court against her local district attorney, Henry Wade, alleging that Texas's abortion laws were unconstitutional. A special three-judge court of the U.S. District Court for the Northern District of Texas heard the case and ruled in her favor. The parties appealed this ruling to the Supreme Court. In January 1973, the Supreme Court issued a 7–2 decision in McCorvey's favor holding that the Due Process Clause of the Fourteenth Amendment to the United States Constitution provides a fundamental ""right to privacy"", which protects a pregnant woman's right to an abortion. It also held that the right to abortion is not absolute and must be balanced against the government's interests in protecting women's health and prenatal life. It resolved these competing interests by announcing a pregnancy trimester timetable to govern all abortion regulations in the United States. The Court also classified the right to abortion as ""fundamental"", which required courts to evaluate challenged abortion laws under the ""strict scrutiny"" standard, the most stringent level of judicial review in the United States. 
The Supreme Court's decision in Roe was among the most controversial in U.S. history. In addition to the dissent, Roe was criticized by some in the legal community, including some who thought that Roe reached the correct result but went about it the wrong way, and some called the decision a form of judicial activism. Others argued that Roe did not go far enough, as it was placed within the framework of civil rights rather than the broader human rights. The decision also radically reconfigured the voting coalitions of the Republican and Democratic parties in the following decades. Anti-abortion politicians and activists sought for decades to restrict abortion or overrule the decision; polls into the 21st century showed that a plurality and a majority, especially into the late 2010s to early 2020s, opposed overruling Roe. Despite criticism of the decision, the Supreme Court reaffirmed Roe's central holding in its 1992 decision, Planned Parenthood v. Casey. Casey overruled Roe's trimester framework and abandoned its ""strict scrutiny"" standard in favor of an ""undue burden"" test.
In June 2022, the Supreme Court overruled Roe and Casey in Dobbs v. Jackson Women's Health Organization on the grounds that the substantive right to abortion was not ""deeply rooted in this Nation's history or tradition"", nor considered a right when the Due Process Clause was ratified in 1868, and was unknown in U.S. law until Roe.",wiki
"Ricci v. DeStefano, 557 U.S. 557 (2009), is a United States labor law case of the United States Supreme Court on unlawful discrimination through disparate impact under the Civil Rights Act of 1964.
Twenty city firefighters at the New Haven Fire Department,  nineteen white and one Hispanic, passed the test for promotion to a management position, yet the city declined to promote them because none of the black firefighters who took the same test scored high enough to be considered for promotion. New Haven officials invalidated the test results because they feared a lawsuit over the test's disproportionate exclusion of a certain racial group (blacks) from promotion under a disparate impact cause of action. The twenty non-black firefighters claimed discrimination under Title VII of the Civil Rights Act of 1964.
The Supreme Court held 5–4 that New Haven's decision to ignore the test results violated Title VII because the city did not have a ""strong basis in evidence"" that it would have subjected itself to disparate impact liability if it had promoted the white and Hispanic firefighters instead of the black firefighters. Because the plaintiffs won under their Title VII claim, the Court did not consider the plaintiffs' argument that New Haven violated the constitutional right to equal protection.",wiki
"Prima Paint Corp. v. Flood & Conklin Mfg. Co., 388 U.S. 395 (1967), is a United States Supreme Court decision that established what has become known as the ""separability principle"" in contracts with arbitration clauses. Following an appellate court ruling a decade earlier, it reads the 1925 Federal Arbitration Act (FAA) to require that any challenges to the enforceability of such a contract first be heard by an arbitrator, not a court, unless the claim is that the clause itself is unenforceable.
The case arose from a claim by a New Jersey manufacturer that a Maryland firm had misrepresented itself in a transaction and thus the contract between the two was unenforceable, precluding the arbitration agreed upon in the event of a dispute. Abe Fortas wrote for a 6-3 majority that the FAA was broad enough to require arbitration of all issues save the arbitration clause itself. Hugo Black's dissent called the majority's interpretation overbroad and at odds with Congressional intent in passing the law. He feared it would put legal matters in the hands of arbitrators with little or no legal understanding of it nor duty to follow the law.
In subsequent cases concerning the FAA, the Court has reaffirmed the separability principle and held that the FAA and this reading of it apply to arbitrable contracts under state law, even in cases where the contract is alleged to be illegal or state law provides for administrative dispute resolution. This has been seen as expanding the use of arbitration in contracts in the later 20th century, not only those between businesses but between businesses and consumers as well.",wiki

"Marcus v. Search Warrant, 367 U.S. 717 (1961), full title Marcus v. Search Warrant of Property at 104 East Tenth Street, Kansas City, Missouri, is an in rem case decided by the United States Supreme Court on the seizure of obscene materials. The Court unanimously overturned a Missouri Supreme Court decision upholding the forfeiture of hundreds of magazines confiscated from a Kansas City wholesaler. It held that both Missouri's procedures for the seizure of allegedly obscene material and the execution of the warrant itself violated the Fourth and Fourteenth amendments' prohibitions on search and seizure without due process. Those violations, in turn, threatened the rights protected by the First Amendment.
The case had begun in 1957, when the Kansas City Police Department vice squad raided the warehouse of a local news distributor and five newsstands. Officers seized dozens of publications, far beyond those which had started the investigation, since the search warrants were not specific. Less than half of the seized titles were ultimately found obscene and ordered to be burned.
Justice William Brennan wrote for the Court. He found the officers' conduct similar to that which had inspired the Founding Fathers to write the Fourth Amendment. He added that the Missouri Supreme Court had incorrectly applied an earlier Court holding in sustaining the forfeiture. The result was a system that operated as an effective prior restraint. Hugo Black, in a concurring opinion, joined by William O. Douglas restated his conviction that the Fourteenth Amendment applies all the rights protected by the Constitution to the states.
Marcus broke ground in holding that First Amendment interests required an additional layer of procedure than other instances of seizure. It would figure prominently in later obscenity cases involving seizures, including one called Quantity of Books v. Kansas, that explicitly tried to take its holding into account. After the Court settled on a definition of obscenity in the early 1970s, it continued to hear other cases on the issues first addressed in Marcus.",wiki
"Old Chief v. United States, 519 U.S. 172 (1997), discussed the limitation on admitting relevant evidence set forth in Federal Rule of Evidence 403.  Under this rule, otherwise relevant evidence may be excluded if the probative value of the evidence is substantially outweighed by the danger of unfair prejudice, confusion of the issues, misleading the jury, or considerations of undue delay, wasting time, or needless presentation of cumulative evidence.  In this case, Old Chief offered to stipulate to the fact of a prior conviction, which was an element of the crime with which he was charged.  The prosecution resisted this stipulation, arguing that it had the right to present its case in any manner it chose.  In Old Chief, the Court applied Rule 403 to the particular situation presented by this case, and concluded that Rule 403 required the trial court to accept the defendant's stipulation to a prior conviction over the prosecution's objection.",wiki

"Mitchell v. Forsyth, 472 U.S. 511 (1985), was a United States Supreme Court case deciding on the issue of immunity of cabinet officers from suits from individuals.
In 1970, John N. Mitchell, Attorney General, authorized a warrantless wiretap for the purpose of gathering intelligence regarding the activities of a radical group that had made tentative plans to take actions threatening the Nation's security. During the time the wiretap was installed, the Government intercepted three conversations between a member of the group and respondent. In 1972, the Supreme Court in United States v. United States District Court (1972), also known as the Keith case, ruled that the Fourth Amendment does not permit warrantless wiretaps in cases involving domestic threats to the national security. Respondent then filed a damages action in Federal District Court against petitioner and others, alleging that the surveillance to which he had been subjected violated the Fourth Amendment and Title III of the Omnibus Crime Control and Safe Streets Act. Ultimately, the District Court, granting respondent's motion for summary judgment on the issue of liability, held that petitioner was not entitled to either absolute or qualified immunity. The Court of Appeals agreed with the denial of absolute immunity, but held, with respect to the denial of qualified immunity, that the District Court's order was not appealable under the collateral order doctrine.

"Gonzales v. Carhart, 550 U.S. 124 (2007), was a landmark decision of the U.S. Supreme Court that upheld the Partial-Birth Abortion Ban Act of 2003. The case reached the high court after U.S. Attorney General, Alberto Gonzales, appealed a ruling of the U.S. Court of Appeals for the Eighth Circuit in favor of LeRoy Carhart that struck down the Act. Also before the Supreme Court was the consolidated appeal of Gonzales v. Planned Parenthood from the U.S. Court of Appeals for the Ninth Circuit, whose ruling had the same effect as that of the Eighth Circuit.
The Supreme Court's decision upheld Congress's ban and held that it did not impose an undue burden on the due process right of women to obtain an abortion, ""under precedents we here assume to be controlling"", such as the Court's prior decisions in Roe v. Wade and Planned Parenthood v. Casey. In a legal sense, the case distinguished but did not overrule Stenberg v. Carhart (2000), in which the Court dealt with related issues. Gonzales was widely interpreted as signaling a shift in Supreme Court jurisprudence toward a restriction of abortion rights, occasioned in part by the retirement of Sandra Day O'Connor and her replacement by Samuel Alito.
The Court found that there is ""uncertainty [in the medical community] over whether the barred procedure is ever necessary to preserve a woman's health"", and in the past the Court ""has given state and federal legislatures wide discretion to pass legislation in areas where there is medical and scientific uncertainty.""",wiki

"Boynton v. Virginia, 364 U.S. 454 (1960), was a landmark decision of the US Supreme Court.  The case overturned a judgment convicting an African American law student for trespassing by being in a restaurant in a bus terminal which was ""whites only"".  It held that racial segregation in public transportation was illegal because such segregation violated the Interstate Commerce Act, which broadly forbade discrimination in interstate passenger transportation. It moreover held that bus transportation was sufficiently related to interstate commerce to allow the United States federal government to regulate it to forbid racial discrimination in the industry.
Thurgood Marshall argued the case for Boynton. The majority opinion was written by Justice Hugo Black.
The significance of Boynton was not located in its holding since it managed to avoid deciding any Constitutional questions in its decision, and its expansive reading of Federal powers regarding interstate commerce was also well established by the time of the decision. Its significance is that its outlawing of racial segregation in public transportation led directly to a movement called the Freedom Rides, in which African Americans and whites together rode various forms of public transportation in the South to challenge local laws or customs that enforced segregation.  The Freedom Rides, and the violent reactions they provoked, prompted Attorney General Robert F. Kennedy to confront the Interstate Commerce Commission (ICC) with its failure to enforce a bus desegregation ruling it had handed down in 1955, Sarah Keys v. Carolina Coach Company, 64 MCC 769 (1955) as well as the companion train desegregation case, NAACP v. St. Louis-Santa Fe Railway Company, 297 ICC 335 (1955). By presenting the commission with its own rulings in a May 29, 1961, petition, Kennedy was able to prompt it to do what it had promised in 1955, five years before the Boynton ruling was handed down, and six years before the Freedom Riders set out to test Boynton across the Deep South. On September 22, 1961, the ICC issued regulations which implemented its 1955 Keys and NAACP rulings, as well as the Supreme Court's ruling in Boynton, and on November 1 those regulations went into effect, effectively ending Jim Crow in public transportation.",wiki

In this case, black and Hispanic parents filed suit against all Denver schools due to racial segregation. The decision on this case, written by Justice William J. Brennan, was key in defining de facto segregation. Brennan found that although there were no official laws supporting segregation in Denver, ""the Board, through its actions over a period of years, intentionally created and maintained the segregated character of the core city schools."" As a result of the ruling, the entire district in Denver, Colorado, must be desegregated. The issue of ""intent"" would become a key factor in the Boston case.",wiki
"Reno v. Flores, 507 U.S. 292 (1993), was a Supreme Court of the United States case that addressed the detention and release of unaccompanied minors.
The Supreme Court ruled that the Immigration and Naturalization Service's regulations regarding the release of alien unaccompanied minors did not violate the Due Process Clause of the United States Constitution. The Court held that ""alien juveniles detained on suspicion of being deportable may be released only to a parent, legal guardian, or other related adult."" The legacy for which Reno v. Flores became known was the subsequent 1997 court-supervised stipulated settlement agreement which is binding on the defendants (the federal government agencies)—the Flores v. Reno Settlement Agreement or Flores Settlement Agreement (FSA) to which both parties in Reno v. Flores agreed in the District Court for Central California (C.D. Cal.). The Flores Settlement Agreement (FSA), supervised by C.D. Cal., has set strict national regulations and standards regarding the detention and treatment of minors by federal agencies for over twenty years. It remains in effect until the federal government introduces final regulations to implement the FSA agreement.  The FSA governs the policy for the treatment of unaccompanied alien children in federal custody of the legacy INS and its successor—United States Department of Homeland Security (DHS) and the various agencies that operate under the jurisdiction of the DHS-in particular the United States Citizenship and Immigration Services (USCIS). The FSA is supervised by a U.S. district judge in the District Court for Central California.
The litigation originated in the class action lawsuit Flores v. Meese filed on July 11, 1985 by the Center for Human Rights and Constitutional Law (CHRCL) and two other organizations on behalf of immigrant minors, including Jenny Lisette Flores, who had been placed in a detention center for male and female adults after being apprehended by the former Immigration and Naturalization Service (INS) as she attempted to illegally cross the Mexico–United States border.
Under the Flores Settlement and current circumstances, DHS asserts that it generally cannot detain alien children and their parents together for more than brief periods. In his June 20, 2018 executive order, President Trump had directed then-Attorney General Jeff Sessions to ask the District Court for the Central District of California, to ""modify"" the Flores agreement to ""allow the government to detain alien families together"" for longer periods, which would include the time it took for the family's immigration proceedings and potential ""criminal proceedings for unlawful entry into the United States"".: 2  On July 9, Judge Gee of the Federal District of California, ruled that there was no basis to amend the 1997 Flores Settlement Agreement (FSA) that ""requires children to be released to licensed care programs within 20 days.""
In 2017, U.S. District Judge Dolly Gee found that children who were in custody of the U.S. Customs and Border Protection lacked ""food, clean water and basic hygiene items"" and were sleep-deprived. She ordered the federal government to provide items such as soap and to improve the conditions. The federal government appealed the decision saying that the order forcing them to offer specific items and services exceeded the original Flores agreement. The June 18, 2019 hearing became infamous and caused nationwide outrage when a video of the Department of Justice senior attorney arguing against providing minors with toothbrushes and soap went viral. The federal government lost their appeal when a three-judge panel of the  United States Court of Appeals for the Ninth Circuit upheld Judge Gee's order on August 15, 2019.",wiki
"Georgia v. McCollum, 505 U.S. 42 (1992), was a case in which the Supreme Court of the United States held that a criminal defendant cannot make peremptory challenges based solely on race. The court had previously held in Batson v. Kentucky (1986) that prosecutors cannot make peremptory challenges based on race, but did not address whether defendants could use them. The court had already ruled in Edmonson v. Leesville Concrete Company (1991) that the Batson prohibition also applies to civil litigants because they are state actors during the jury selection process.
However, in Polk County v. Dodson, the court had held that a public defender is not a state actor in the context of a lawsuit for inadequate legal representation. McCollum argued that Polk County was the controlling precedent, so public defenders are not state actors during jury selection. Writing for the court, Justice Harry Blackmun disagreed. Blackmun found that whether a public defender is a state actor ""depends on the nature and context of the function he is performing."" Just as he is a state actor in the context of personnel decisions like hiring and firing attorneys in his office, a public defender is a state actor in the context of peremptory challenges. Like in Edmonson, Blackmun found that race-based peremptory challenges by the defendant violate the Equal Protection Clause and are therefore unconstitutional.

Oral argument for this case  was consolidated with Grayned v. City of Rockford, but separate opinions were issued for each. Earl Mosley had protested employment discrimination by carrying a sign on the sidewalk in front of a Chicago high school, until the city of Chicago made it illegal to do so. Although Chicago believed that its ordinance was a time, place, or manner restriction, and therefore was a constitutional law, the Supreme Court ruled that it was a content-based restriction, because it treated labor-related protests differently from other protests. Since the ordinance did not meet the higher standards for content-based restrictions, it was ruled unconstitutional.",wiki
"Atascadero State Hospital v. Scanlon, 473 U.S. 234 (1985), was a United States Supreme Court case regarding Congress' power to abrogate the Eleventh Amendment sovereign immunity of the states.
Ordinarily, sovereign immunity prohibits the states from being sued, and the Eleventh Amendment prohibits states from being sued without consent in federal court; however, there are exceptions. A state can waive its sovereign immunity, and in Fitzpatrick v. Bitzer, 427 U.S. 445 (1976), the Supreme Court had emphasized that Congress could abrogate state sovereign immunity pursuant to powers granted it by the Civil War Amendments. The Court noted that Edelman v. Jordan, 415 U.S. 651 (1974), however, had recognized that ""the Eleventh Amendment implicates the fundamental constitutional balance between the Federal Government and the States,"" Atascadero, at 238, the Court had applied a clear statement rule to waiver. The Court will only deem the state to have waived its immunity when the waiver is couched in ""the most express language or by such overwhelming implication from the text as [will] leave no room for any other reasonable construction."" Murray v. Wilson Distilling Co., 213 U.S. 151, 171 (1909).
In Atascadero, the Court made the rule symmetrical: just as purported waiver requires a clear statement, so too a purported abrogation requires a clear statement. Reiterating its ""reluctance to infer that a State's immunity from suit in the federal courts has been negated[,] stem[ming] from recognition of the vital role of the doctrine of sovereign immunity in our federal system,"" Pennhurst State School and Hospital v. Halderman, 465 U.S. 89, 98 (1984) (Pennhurst II), and citing ""[t]he fundamental nature of the interests implicated by the Eleventh Amendment,"" Atascadero, at 242, the court held ""that Congress may abrogate the States' constitutionally secured immunity from suit in federal court only by making its intention unmistakably clear in the language of the statute."" Id.
In response to Atascadero, Congress enacted a statute providing the clear language that the Court had demanded. The Rehabilitation Act Amendments of 1986 stated that ""a State shall not be immune under the Eleventh Amendment... from suit in Federal court for a violation"" of relevant provisions of federal law.",wiki

After being found guilty of murder, Jonathan Dale Simmons faced either execution or life in prison without parole. The State asked the jury to sentence Mr. Simmons to death, in part because he posed a future danger to society. Although Mr. Simmons repeatedly requested permission to instruct the jury that he would never be released from prison, these requests were denied by the trial court. Denying Mr. Simmons his requested instruction violated his due process rights, the Supreme Court held, and presented to the jury a ""false choice between sentencing petitioner to death and sentencing him to a limited period of incarceration.""

If this happens, the parolee can leave a list of questions for the victim to answer. Evidence including letters, affidavits, and other material that would not be admissible in an adversary criminal trial can be allowed in a Morrissey hearing.
After the hearing, the factfinders issue a written statement as to the evidence relied upon and reasons for revoking parole. The victim can be notified about the outcome.
Brennan and Marshall noted in their concurrence, ""The only question open under our precedents is whether counsel must be furnished the parolee if he is indigent.""",wiki

Reed, the Supreme Court held that the statuettes—male and female dancing figures made of semivitreous china—used as bases for fully equipped electric lamps were copyrightable, even though the lamp itself was a utilitarian mass-produced item.
The case is notable for the quotation, ""Unlike a patent, a copyright gives no exclusive right to the art disclosed; protection is given only to the expression of the idea—not the idea itself."" 347 U.S. at 217 (citing F.

The case involved a black man, Heman Marion Sweatt, who was refused admission to the School of Law of the University of Texas, whose president was Theophilus Painter, on the grounds that the Texas State Constitution prohibited integrated education.

"Texas v. Johnson, 491 U.S. 397 (1989), is a landmark decision by the Supreme Court of the United States in which the Court held, 5–4, that burning the Flag of the United States was protected speech under the First Amendment to the U.S. Constitution, as doing so counts as symbolic speech and political speech.
In the case, activist Gregory Lee Johnson was convicted for burning an American flag during a protest outside the 1984 Republican National Convention in Dallas, Texas, and was fined $2,000 and sentenced to one year in jail in accordance with Texas law. Justice William Brennan wrote for the five-justice majority that Johnson's flag burning was protected under the freedom of speech, and therefore the state could not censor Johnson nor punish him for his actions.
The ruling invalidated prohibitions on desecrating the American flag, which at the time were enforced in 48 of the 50 states. The ruling was unpopular with the general public and lawmakers, with President George H. W. Bush calling flag burning ""dead wrong"". The ruling was challenged by Congress, which passed the Flag Protection Act later that year, making flag desecration a federal crime. The law's constitutionality was contested before the Supreme Court, which again affirmed in United States v. Eichman (1990) that flag burning was a protected form of free speech and struck down the Flag Protection Act as violating the 

First Amendment. In the years following the ruling, Congress several times considered the Flag Desecration Amendment, which would have amended the Constitution to make flag burning illegal, but never passed it. The issue of flag burning remained controversial decades later, and it is still used as a form of protest.
Time magazine described it as one of the best Supreme Court decisions since 1960, with legal scholars since stating about it that ""Freedom of speech applies to symbolic expression, such as displaying flags, burning flags, wearing armbands, burning crosses, and the like.""",wiki
"South Carolina v. Catawba Indian Tribe, Inc., 476 U.S. 498 (1986), is an important U.S. Supreme Court precedent for aboriginal title in the United States decided in the wake of County of Oneida v. Oneida Indian Nation of New York State (Oneida II) (1985).  Distinguishing Oneida II, the Court held that federal policy did not preclude the application of a state statute of limitations to the land claim of a tribe that had been terminated, such as the Catawba tribe.
The Court remanded to the United States Court of Appeals for the Fourth Circuit to determine whether South Carolina's statute of limitations applied to the facts of the case.   All together, the Fourth Circuit heard oral arguments in the case seven times, six of those times sitting en banc, i.e. all the judges on the Circuit rather than a panel of three (although the Circuit wrote only five published opinions).   The Fourth Circuit determined that the limitations statute only barred the claim against those defendants that could satisfy the standards of adverse possession and upheld the trial court's denial of a defendant class certification.
These rulings would have required the Catawbas to file individual lawsuits against the estimated 60,000 landowners in the area.  The complaints were prepared and printed, but the parties reached a settlement before the date on which the Catawbas would have been required to file the individual complaints.  Congress ratified the settlement, extinguishing all aboriginal title held by the Catawbas in exchange for $50,000,000—$32,000,000 paid by the federal government and $18,000,000 paid by the state.",wiki

"Mapp v.

The Supreme Court accomplished this by use of a principle known as selective incorporation. In Mapp, this involved the incorporation of the provisions, as interpreted by the Court, of the 4th Amendment, which applies only to actions of the federal government into the 14th Amendment's due process clause. Citing Boyd v.

Doud, his partners and one of his agents, fearing prosecution under the law, sued the state, arguing the law was unconstitutional. The Supreme Court agreed, finding the special exemption only for American Express violated the Equal Protection Clause of the Fourteenth Amendment.

"United States v. Jorn, 400 U.S. 470 (1971), was a United States Supreme Court decision clarifying when a criminal defendant may be retried after a mistrial. In this case, where a trial judge abruptly declared a mistrial to prevent the prosecution's witness from incriminating himself, a second trial was barred by the Double Jeopardy Clause.
Jorn was charged with numerous counts of assisting in the preparation of fraudulent income tax returns. He was tried in the United States District Court for the District of Utah. Among the government's witnesses were five taxpayers whom Jorn had allegedly assisted in preparing fraudulent returns. As the first of these witnesses was called, the trial judge became concerned the witness was about to incriminate himself, and refused to allow the witness to testify until the same had consulted an attorney. Upon learning that all five witnesses were in the same situation, the judge discharged the jury and aborted the trial. The case was then set for retrial before a different jury, but Jorn argued that retrial was forbidden by double jeopardy.
The question of when a retrial is permitted after a mistrial is flexible and depends on the circumstances of the case. Here, the trial judge had acted sua sponte, abruptly discharging the jury without input from either the prosecution or defense. The Court used the framework of United States v. Perez to evaluate this action, asking whether there was ""manifest necessity"" to declare the mistrial. Here, the Court concluded, ""the trial judge here abused his discretion in discharging the jury,"" suggesting instead the possibility of a continuance. Justice Harlan pointed out the potential injustice of subjecting the defendant to a second trial, writing, ""Reprosecution after a mistrial has unnecessarily been declared ... subjects the defendant to ... personal strain and insecurity.""
In conclusion, since there was not ""manifest necessity"" for the trial judge to declare the mistrial, Jorn could not be reprosecuted.",wiki
"Cuomo v. Clearing House Association, L.L.C., 557 U.S. 519 (2009), was a case decided by the United States Supreme Court. In a 5–4 decision, the court determined that a federal banking regulation did not pre-empt the ability of states to enforce their own fair-lending laws. The Court determined that the Office of the Comptroller of the Currency is the sole regulator of national banks but it does not have the authority under the National Bank Act to pre-empt state law enforcement against national banks.
The case came out of an interpretation of the US Treasury Department's Office of the Comptroller of the Currency which had blocked an investigation by New York into lending practices. The OCC claimed that the 1864 National Bank Act bars states from enforcing their own laws against national banks.
Justice Scalia stated in the opinion that while the OCC has ""visitorial powers,"" the right to examine the affairs of a corporation, that does not mean that it has the exclusive right to enforcement. ""A sovereign's 'visitorial powers' and its power to enforce the law are two different things. Contrary to what the [OCC's] regulation says, the National Bank Act pre-empts only the former."" Scalia noted that states ""have always enforced their general laws against national banks—and have enforced their banking-related laws against national banks for at least 85 years.""
The case is notable for the justices composing the 5-4 majority, which included the liberal justices (John Paul Stevens, David Souter, Ruth Bader Ginsburg, and Stephen Breyer) along with the conservative Scalia, who authored the opinion. Justice Clarence Thomas, joined by Justices Samuel Alito, Anthony Kennedy, and Chief Justice John Roberts, wrote a dissent.
The case is further notable for the suggested relationship of this OCC decision to the financial crisis of 2007–2010.",wiki

In other words, police officers have absolute immunity from civil liability for lying on the stand in criminal cases.

Some police officers followed the suspect vehicle, and pulled over the car because it was ""riding low"". Without a warrant, they searched the trunk and found untaxed liquor. The car was seized, and the state also attempted to confiscate the automobile in question as a civil penalty. The Court ruled unanimously that the Fourth Amendment's protection against unreasonable searches and seizures, held applicable to the states by the Fourteenth Amendment, applies to civil actions by the states as well as criminal ones, noting that one could be subject to an even worse penalty in a civil proceeding, where the value of the items being forfeited might be more than the maximum possible fine in a criminal case.

"United States v. 12 200-ft. Reels of Film, 413 U.S. 123 (1973), was an in rem case decided by the United States Supreme Court that considered the question of whether the First Amendment required that citizens be allowed to import obscene material for their personal and private use at home, which was already held to be protected several years earlier. By a 5–4 margin, the Court held that it did not.
This case was very similar to United States v. Thirty-seven Photographs, a case the Court had heard two years earlier. It began when the films, and other visual and textual material with predominant explicit sexual content, were seized by customs agents from Paladini, a California man returning from Mexico. Federal law at the time prohibited the import of any material that might be judged to be obscene. Paladini challenged the forfeiture proceedings the government initiated, on the grounds that he intended the material for his personal use in the privacy of his own home, an activity the Court had ruled was protected under the First Amendment in Stanley v. Georgia. Thus, he argued, he had a right to obtain such material abroad for that purpose.
After a district court panel agreed with him and declared the statute unconstitutional, the case went to the Supreme Court directly. Its opinion was one of four obscenity cases handed down, along with Miller v. California, in which the Court announced a new standard of obscenity for the first time since Roth v. United States 17 years before. By a 5–4 margin, the Court held that the statute was constitutional, but it also ordered the district court to review the material under its new standard and consider whether it was still obscene.
Chief Justice Warren Burger wrote for the majority, reaffirming a similar holding in Thirty-seven Photographs that the right to possess something in one's home which might otherwise be unlawful outside of it did not give rise to a right to import it. William O. Douglas wrote a lengthy dissent, responding as much to the majority holding in Miller, arguing that history showed obscenity laws were not vigorously enforced at the time the Bill of Rights was adopted and thus could not be justified on traditionalist grounds. William Brennan wrote a shorter dissent, joined by the other two justices, calling the statute overbroad.",wiki

The decision notably set a standard by which a valid consensual stop could be converted into an unconstitutional Terry stop, such as by ""the threatening presence of several officers, the display of a weapon by an officer, some physical touching of the person of the citizen, or the use of language or tone of voice indicating that compliance with the officer's request might be compelled.""",wiki

"Goesaert v. Cleary, 335 U.S. 464 (1948), was a United States Supreme Court case in which the Court upheld a Michigan law, which prohibited women from being licensed as a bartender in all cities having a population of 50,000 or more unless their father or husband owned the establishment. Valentine Goesaert, the plaintiff in the case, challenged the law on the ground that it infringed on the Fourteenth Amendment's Equal Protection Clause. Speaking for the majority, Justice Felix Frankfurter affirmed the judgment of the Detroit district court and upheld the constitutionality of the state law. The state argued that since the profession of bartending could potentially lead to moral and social problems for women, it was within the state's power to bar them from working as bartenders. Only when the owner of the bar was a sufficiently close relative to the woman bartender, it was argued, could it be guaranteed that such immorality would not be present.
The decision was subsequently overruled by Craig v. Boren (1976).",wiki
"Menominee Tribe v. United States, 391 U.S. 404 (1968), is a case in which the Supreme Court ruled that the Menominee Indian Tribe kept their historical hunting and fishing rights even after the federal government ceased to recognize the tribe. It was a landmark decision in Native American case law.
The Menominee Indian Tribe had entered into a series of treaties with the United States that did not specifically state that they had hunting and fishing rights. In 1961, Congress terminated the tribe's federal recognition, ending its right to govern itself, federal support of health care and education programs, police and fire protection, and tribal rights to land. In 1963, three members of the tribe were charged with violating Wisconsin's hunting and fishing laws on land which had been a reservation for over 100 years. The tribe members were acquitted, but when the state appealed, the Wisconsin Supreme Court held that the Menominee tribe no longer had hunting and fishing rights because of the termination action by Congress.
The tribe sued the United States for compensation in the US Court of Claims, which ruled that tribal members still had hunting and fishing rights and that Congress had not abrogated the rights. The opposite rulings by the state and federal courts brought the issue to the Supreme Court. In 1968, the Supreme Court held that the tribe retained its hunting and fishing rights under the treaties involved and the rights were not lost after federal recognition was ended by the Menominee Indian Termination Act without a clear and unequivocal statement by Congress removing the rights.

The petitioner, Eugene Frank Robel, who worked at Todd Shipyards in Seattle, was indicted on May 21, 1963, for being a member of the Communist Party of the United States (CPUSA) and thus affiliated with it, without being registered with the Subversive Activities Control Board in violation of the McCarran Internal Security Act section 5 (a) (I) (D). Since the act required CPUSA to register as a Communist Party, he was told because of his affiliation with the Party, he also had to register as well, and that he could no longer work at the shipyard because of his affiliation with the Communist Party; Todd Shipyards had been designated a ""defense"" facility, otherwise known as federal employment, which was illegal under the McCarran Act.

"Swann v. Charlotte-Mecklenburg Board of Education, 402 U.S. 1 (1971), was a landmark United States Supreme Court case dealing with the busing of students to promote integration in public schools. The Court held that busing was an appropriate remedy for the problem of racial imbalance in schools, even when the imbalance resulted from the selection of students based on geographic proximity to the school rather than from deliberate assignment based on race. This was done to ensure the schools would be ""properly"" integrated and that all students would receive equal educational opportunities regardless of their race.
Judge John J. Parker of the U.S. Court of Appeals for the Fourth Circuit interpreted the Brown v. Board of Education case as a charge not to segregate rather than an order to integrate.  In 1963, the Court ruled in McNeese v. Board of Education and Goss v. Board of Education in favor of integration, and showed impatience with efforts to end segregation.  In 1968 the Warren Court ruled in Green v. County School Board that freedom of choice plans were insufficient to eliminate segregation; thus, it was necessary to take proactive steps to integrate schools.  In United States v. Montgomery County Board of Education (1969), Judge Frank Johnson's desegregation order for teachers was upheld, allowing an approximate ratio of the races to be established by a district judge.",wiki

"Monsanto Co. v. Geertson Seed Farms, 561 U.S. 139 (2010), is a United States Supreme Court case decided 7-1 in favor of Monsanto.  The decision allowed Monsanto to sell genetically modified alfalfa seeds to farmers, and allowed farmers to plant them, grow crops, harvest them, and sell the crop into the food supply. The case came about because the use of the seeds was approved by regulatory authorities; the approval was challenged in district court by Geertson Seed Farms and other groups who were concerned that the genetically modified alfalfa would spread too easily, and the challengers won.  Monsanto appealed the district court decision and lost, and appealed again to the Supreme Court, where Monsanto won, thus upholding the original approval and allowing the seeds to be sold.
In 2005 the United States Department of Agriculture's Animal and Plant Health Inspection Service (APHIS) deregulated Monsanto's Roundup-ready alfalfa (RRA) based on an Environmental Assessment (EA) of Monsanto's RRA.  In 2006, Geertson Seed Farm and others filed suit in a California district court against APHIS' deregulation of RRA. The district court disallowed APHIS' deregulation of RRA and issued an injunction against any new planting of RRA pending the preparation of a much more extensive Environmental Impact Statement (EIS). The court also refused to allow a partial deregulation.
After losing an appeal at the United States Court of Appeals for the Ninth Circuit,  Monsanto and others appealed the decision to the U.S. Supreme Court in 2009. In 2010 the Supreme Court reversed the lower court's decision to bar partial deregulation of RRA pending completion of the EIS.  They stated that, before a court disallow a partial deregulation, a plaintiff must show that it has suffered irreparable injury. ""The District Court abused its discretion in enjoining APHIS from effecting a partial deregulation and in prohibiting the planting of RRA pending the agency’s completion of its detailed environmental review."" The Supreme court did not consider the district court's ruling disallowing RRA's deregulation and consequently RRA was still a regulated crop waiting for APHIS' completion of an EIS. At the time, both sides claimed victory. This was the first ruling of the United States Supreme Court on genetically engineered crops.

"Rodriguez de Quijas v. Shearson/American Express Inc., 490 U.S. 477 (1989), is a United States Supreme Court decision concerning the arbitration of securities fraud claims. It was originally brought by a group of Texas investors against their brokerage house. By a 5–4 margin the Court affirmed the Fifth Circuit Court of Appeals and ruled that their claims under the Securities Act of 1933, which regulates trading in the primary market, must be arbitrated as stipulated in their customer agreements.
The decision overruled a 1953 case, Wilko v. Swan. Justice Anthony Kennedy's majority opinion found that arbitration procedures offered more adequate protection for investors than they had when that case was decided. John Paul Stevens's short dissent criticized the majority for taking it upon itself to overturn a precedent that, he argued, Congress had purposely left intact during a major overhaul of the securities laws in the mid-1970s. Both criticized the Fifth Circuit for having overruled Wilko before the Court itself did, reminding lower courts that only the Supreme Court could overrule itself, an aspect of the decision that has come in for some criticism.
Many courts besides the Fifth Circuit had chosen to disregard Wilko after the Supreme Court's own decision in Shearson/American Express Inc. v. McMahon that claims under the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, which applies to the secondary market, were also arbitrable if a contract so provided cast serious doubt on the logic of the older case. As a result of Rodriguez de Quijas, many more securities fraud claims were heard in arbitration instead of the courts, an intended outcome that has supporters and critics and led to long-term changes in how the securities industry conducts arbitration. The decision was the last in the Mitsubishi trilogy, which expanded the use of arbitration from contractual disputes to statutory claims during the 1980s.",wiki
"Burks v.

It established the constitutional rule that where an appellate court reverses a criminal conviction on the ground that the prosecution failed to present sufficient evidence to prove the defendant's guilt beyond a reasonable doubt, the Double Jeopardy Clause shields the defendant from a second prosecution for the same offense. Notwithstanding the power that appellate courts have under section 2106 to ""remand the cause and direct the entry of such appropriate judgment, decree, or order, or require such further proceedings to be had as may be just under the circumstances,"" a court that reverses a conviction for insufficiency of the evidence may not allow the lower court a choice on remand between acquitting the defendant and ordering a new trial.

"Smith v. California, 361 U.S. 147 (1959), was a U.S. Supreme Court case upholding the freedom of the press.

Smith v. California continued the Supreme Court precedent of ruling that questions of freedom of expression were protected by the Due Process Clause of the Fourteenth Amendment from invasion by state action.  It also established that in order for one to be criminally liable for possession of obscene material, there must be proof of one's knowledge of the material.

United States, 449 U.S. 490 (1981), is a decision of the Supreme Court of the United States on the citizenship status of Feodor Fedorenko, a naturalized citizen who had lied about his past as a guard at a Nazi death camp on his visa and citizenship applications. The Court decided that because Fedorenko lied on his visa application, his visa and citizenship were invalid. Fedorenko was a Ukrainian-born soldier who fought in World War II, was captured, and served as a guard at Treblinka extermination camp for over a year. He emigrated to the United States in 1949, lying on his visa application to cover up his time at Treblinka. He lived a quiet life in the U.S. for decades, but when the government became aware of his past, they initiated denaturalization proceedings against him in 1977, looking to revoke his citizenship. As a result of Fedorenko's eventual loss, he was deported to the Soviet Union and executed for treason and war crimes.
Fedorenko arose out of a growing public consciousness of Nazis living quietly within the United States; investigations into the matter began at public urging in the early '70s, but proved to be slow-going and ineffective. When the government did file suit, it proved wholly unprepared for trial, owing to the Immigration and Naturalization Service (INS)'s unfamiliarity with the court system. The District Court for the Southern District of Florida ruled for Fedorenko, but the Fifth Circuit Court of Appeals reversed that decision. Justice Thurgood Marshall, writing for a 7–2 Supreme Court majority, upheld the appeals court's judgment on modified reasoning. Justice Harry Blackmun and Chief Justice Warren E. Burger concurred, while Justices Byron White and John Paul Stevens dissented.
Initially, the district court ruled for Fedorenko on the grounds that the government had failed to prove that Fedorenko's service was voluntary, rather than under duress; neither the appeals court nor the Supreme Court challenged this position, but the Supreme Court ruled that whether it was voluntary or not, serving as a guard at Treblinka would have led to him being denied a visa under the relevant law, and thus his visa was invalid. This holding allowed the Supreme Court to sidestep a question of materiality at issue in the lower courts; the district court interpreted the Supreme Court's decision in Chaunt v. United States (1960) as requiring the government to show that had Fedorenko would have conclusively been denied entry had the truth been known, while the appeals court interpreted the same case as requiring the government to show that Fedorenko only might have been denied entry under the same circumstances. The Supreme Court held that it was not necessary to resolve the Chaunt question to reach a verdict. The district court also ruled that even if Fedorenko was ineligible for citizenship, it could refuse to revoke his citizenship under the principle of equitable discretion – when a proceeding is held in equity, a court can rule based on a consideration of the facts and the fairest result, rather than a strict interpretation of the law. The appeals court and Supreme Court, however, disagreed, ruling that equitable discretion does not allow a court to overlook illegally procured citizenship.

The Supreme Court's ruling that Fedorenko was ineligible as a matter of law owing to being a Treblinka guard assisted government officials in future cases against suspected Nazi collaborators, but the Court earned criticism for its failure to clarify the materiality standard and for not allowing duress as a defense. Some commentators agreed with the district court's holding that if duress was not an exception, the act would bar Jewish kapos or even those forced to cut prisoners' hair from entry, while others agreed with the Supreme Court in finding that argument unconvincing. In concurrence, Harry Blackmun argued that the Court should applied Chaunt to the case; in dissent, John Paul Stevens argued against the Court's interpretation of duress in the DPA; and also in dissent, Byron White argued that the Court should have clarified Chaunt and remanded the case back to the appeals court to review the district court's findings. After Fedorenko's loss at the Supreme Court, he was deported to the Soviet Union in 1984, pled guilty to war crimes in 1986, and was executed in 1987.",wiki

"Roth v. United States, 354 U.S. 476 (1957), along with its companion case Alberts v. California, was a landmark decision of the Supreme Court of the United States which redefined the constitutional test for determining what constitutes obscene material unprotected by the First Amendment. The Court, in an opinion by Justice William J. Brennan Jr. created a test to determine what constituted obscene material: Whether the average person, applying contemporary community standards would find that the material appeals to a prurient interest in sex, and whether the material was utterly without redeeming social value. Although the Court upheld Roth’s conviction and allowed some obscenity prosecutions, it drastically loosened obscenity laws. The decision dissatisfied both social conservatives who thought that it had gone too far in tolerating sexual imagery, and liberals who felt that it infringed on the rights of consenting adults.
The decision was superseded by Miller v. California which removed the ""utterly without redeeming social value"" test, and replaced it with without ""serious literary, artistic, political, or scientific value"".

Section 204(b) allowed the Secretary to preclude the recoupment if the disability recipient was without fault and adjustments or recovery would ""defeat the purposes"" of the Act or ""be against equity and good conscience.""
Under the Department's procedures, after a recipient was notified of the ex parte determination that an overpayment had been made, the recipient could file a written request either seeking reconsideration of that determination or asking the Secretary to waive recovery in accordance with 204(b). The recoupment would start if the agency's decision on the request went against the recipient, and an oral hearing would be granted only if the recipient continued to object to recoupment.
A number of beneficiaries challenged the Department's procedure under the due process clause of the Fifth Amendment to the US Constitution.

"Mueller v. Allen, 463 U.S. 388 (1983), was a United States Supreme Court case examining the constitutionality of a state tax deduction granted to taxpaying parents for school-related expenses, including expenses incurred from private secular and religious schools. The plaintiffs claimed that a Minnesota statute, allowing tax deductions for both public and private school expenses, had the effect of subsidizing religious instruction since parents who paid tuition to religious schools received a larger deduction than parents of public school students, who incurred no tuition expenses.
In a 5–4 decision, the Court upheld the statute. The majority affirmed that the benefit was religiously neutral because the deduction applied equally to sectarian and nonsectarian tuition and that the choice of religious or nonreligious instruction was made by individual parents, not the state. Also, aid was given to parents, not schools.
The dissenting opinion argued that the tax deduction violated the US Constitution because it was an indirect government subsidy of religion, providing a financial incentive to parents to send their children to religious schools.

"Microsoft Corp. v. i4i Ltd. Partnership, 564 U.S. 91 (2011), was a case decided by the Supreme Court of the United States. It deals with the presumption of validity and  the standard of evidence in patent lawsuits. This case in widely considered as a prime example of a frivolous lawsuit by a patent troll, underscoring the need for a reform of the US patent law.
The case was a patent dispute between small Toronto-based company i4i Ltd. Partnership and Microsoft for infringement of a patent regarding custom XML encoding in Microsoft Word, a feature that was “used by only a small fraction of Microsoft’s customers”. The original lawsuit was filed in the Federal Court for the Eastern District of Texas, known for its decisions favoring patent trolls. i4i prevailed both in the district court and on appeal to the CAFC. The latter awarded i4i  $200 million against Microsoft as a reasonable royalty.
Under 35 U.S.C. § 282, a patent, which has been examined and issued by the USPTO is entitled to a presumption of validity in courts, and this presumption can be overcome based on clear and convincing evidence.
On appeal to the SCOTUS Microsoft argued that the clear and convincing evidence standard applied by the Federal Circuit was inappropriate, and that because of the  backlog of unexamined patent applications at the USPTO, patent examiners do not have adequate amount of time to examine patent applications, and therefore a preponderance of the evidence standard should be applied by courts, when patent validity is challenged.
The US Supreme Court rejected Microsoft's position. Judge Sotomayor wrote: ""Congress has amended the patent laws to account for concerns about 'bad' patents, including by expanding the reexamination process to provide for inter partes proceedings. Through it all the evidentiary standard adopted in §282 has gone untouched.""

It was the first Supreme Court case to address gay rights since Bowers v. Hardwick (1986), when the Court had held that laws criminalizing sodomy were constitutional.
The Court ruled in a 6–3 decision that a state constitutional amendment in Colorado preventing protected status based upon homosexuality or bisexuality did not satisfy the Equal Protection Clause.

The decision effectively prevented states from collecting any sales tax from retail purchases made over the Internet or other e-Commerce route unless the seller had a physical presence in the state. The ruling was based on the Dormant Commerce Clause, preventing states from interfering with interstate commerce unless authorized by the United States Congress. The case resulted from an attempt by North Dakota seeking to collect sales tax on licensed computer software offered by the Quill Corporation, an office supply retailer with no North Dakota presence, that allowed users to place orders directly with Quill.
Quill modified an earlier court decision, National Bellas Hess, Inc. v. Department of Revenue of Illinois, which dealt with a state imposing the duty of use tax collection on a mail order reseller.

"Ledbetter v. Goodyear Tire & Rubber Co., 550 U.S. 618 (2007), is an employment discrimination decision of the Supreme Court of the United States.  The result was that employers could not be sued under Title VII of the Civil Rights Act of 1964 over race or gender pay discrimination if the claims were based on decisions made by the employer 180 days or more before the claim. Justice Alito held for the five-justice majority that each paycheck received did not constitute a discrete discriminatory act, even if it was affected by a prior decision outside the time limit. Ledbetter's claim of the “paycheck accrual rule” was rejected. The decision did not prevent plaintiffs from suing under other laws, like the Equal Pay Act, which has a three-year deadline for most sex discrimination claims, or 42 U.S.C. 1981, which has a four-year deadline for suing over race discrimination.
This was a case of statutory rather than constitutional interpretation, explaining the meaning of a law, not deciding its constitutionality. The plaintiff in this case, Lilly Ledbetter, characterized her situation as one where ""disparate pay is received during the statutory limitations period, but is the result of intentionally discriminatory pay decisions that occurred outside the limitations period.""  In rejecting Ledbetter's appeal, the Supreme Court said that ""she could have, and should have, sued"" when the pay decisions were made, instead of waiting beyond the 180-day statutory charging period.  The Court did leave open the possibility that a plaintiff could sue beyond the 180-day period if she did not, and could not, have discovered the discrimination earlier.  The effect of the Court's holding was reversed by the passage of the Lilly Ledbetter Fair Pay Act in 2009.",wiki

"Schmerber v. California, 384 U.S. 757 (1966), was a landmark United States Supreme Court case in which the Court clarified the application of the Fourth Amendment's protection against warrantless searches and the Fifth Amendment right against self-incrimination for searches that intrude into the human body. Until Schmerber, the Supreme Court had not yet clarified whether state police officers must procure a search warrant before taking blood samples from criminal suspects. Likewise, the Court had not yet clarified whether blood evidence taken against the wishes of a criminal suspect may be used against that suspect in the course of a criminal prosecution.
In a 5–4 opinion, the Court held that forced extraction and analysis of a blood sample is not compelled testimony; therefore, it does not violate the Fifth Amendment right against self-incrimination. The Court also held that intrusions into the human body ordinarily require a search warrant. However, the Court ruled that the involuntary, warrantless blood sample taken in this case was justified under the Fourth Amendment's exigent circumstances exception because evidence of blood alcohol would be destroyed by the body's natural metabolic processes if the officers were to wait for a warrant. In 2013, the Supreme Court clarified in Missouri v. McNeely that the natural metabolism of alcohol in the bloodstream is not a per se exigency that would always justify warrantless blood tests of individuals suspected of driving under the influence of alcohol.
In the years following the Court's decision in Schmerber, many legal scholars feared the ruling would be used to limit civil liberties. Other scholars, including Nita A. Farahany, Benjamin Holley, and John G. New, have suggested courts may use the ruling in Schmerber to justify the use of mind reading devices against criminal suspects. Because the Court's ruling in Schmerber prohibited the use of warrantless blood tests in most circumstances, some commentators argue that the decision was responsible for the proliferation of breathalyzers to test for alcohol and urine analyses to test for controlled substances in criminal investigations.",wiki

The Double Jeopardy Clause prevents a state from relitigating a question already decided in favor of a defendant at a previous trial.

A society of doctors in Maricopa County, Arizona, established maximum fees that their members could claim for seeing patients who were covered by certain health insurance plans. Arizona charged them with violations of state antitrust law regarding price fixing. The society tried to rebut the state's charges by claiming that the maximum-fee arrangement was necessary to allow doctors to see these patients, and therefore generated economic benefits.
On appeal, the Supreme Court rejected this defense, saying that price fixing was not truly necessary here: the society could have used insurance to pool their risk. The society's efficiency justification was either a pretext, or else could have been done through less restrictive means. The Court held that their justifications failed as a matter of fact.",wiki

"Atlantic Sounding Co. v. Townsend, 557 U.S. 404 (2009), was a decision by the Supreme Court of the United States holding that a seaman may recover punitive damages from his employer for failure to pay maintenance and cure.  Townsend reversed a line of cases, starting with Guevara v. Maritime Overseas Corp. in the United States Court of Appeals for the Fifth Circuit (New Orleans), that restricted damages in maritime personal injury cases only to ""pecuniary"" damages.  Consequently, a seaman can now recover both attorney's fees and punitive damages for the willful and wanton refusal of a shipowner to provide medical care to a seaman injured on the job.  The Court's 5-4 opinion was delivered by Justice Clarence Thomas.
The Court explained that Congress never used the words ""pecuniary"" or ""non-pecuniary"" to describe the damages available for personal injuries (injuries not causing death) under either the Jones Act or the Federal Employers Liability Act.  Congress merely said ""damages""; hence, any limitation on those damages to ""pecuniary damages"" was a creation of the courts, not Congress.  The Court stated that it ""will not attribute words to Congress that Congress did not say.""",wiki
"United States v. U.S. District Court, 407 U.S. 297 (1972), also known as the Keith Case, was a landmark United States Supreme Court decision that upheld, in a unanimous 8-0 ruling, the requirements of the Fourth Amendment in cases of domestic surveillance targeting a domestic threat.
The United States charged John Sinclair, Lawrence 'Pun' Plamondon, and John Forrest with conspiracy to destroy government property. One of the defendants, Lawrence 'Pun' Plamondon, was also charged with the dynamite bombing of an office of the Central Intelligence Agency in Ann Arbor, Michigan. The defendants were leaders of the radical White Panther Party. In response to a pretrial motion by the defense for disclosure of all electronic surveillance information, Nixon's attorney general, John Mitchell, claimed he authorized the wiretaps pursuant to Title III of the Omnibus Crime Control and Safe Streets Act of 1968 and was not required to disclose the sources. Though warrantless, the act allows for an exception to prevent the overthrow of the government and when ""any other clear and present danger to the structure or existence of the Government"" exists. The Government contended that since the defendants were members of a domestic organization attempting to subvert and destroy it, this case fell under the exception clause.
After reading the briefs and hearing oral arguments by constitutional law attorney Hugh M. ""Buck"" Davis, Judge Damon Keith of the United States District Court for the Eastern District of Michigan disagreed and ordered the Government to disclose all of the illegally intercepted conversations to the defendants. The Government appealed, filing a petition for a writ of mandamus with the Court of Appeals for the Sixth Circuit to set aside the order.

"Trop v. Dulles, 356 U.S. 86 (1958), was a United States Supreme Court case in which the Court ruled that it was unconstitutional to revoke citizenship as a punishment for a crime. The ruling's reference to ""evolving standards of decency"" is frequently cited in Eighth Amendment jurisprudence.
Albert Trop was a natural born citizen of the United States who, while serving as a private in the United States Army in 1944, escaped from an Army stockade in Casablanca, Morocco. The next day, he willingly surrendered to an army officer and was taken back to the base, where he was subsequently court-martialed, convicted of desertion, and sentenced to three years at hard labor, forfeiture of pay, and a dishonorable discharge.
In 1952, Trop applied for a US passport, which was denied because §401(g) of the Nationality Act of 1940 provided that members of the armed forces of the United States who were convicted and dishonorably discharged for wartime desertion would lose their citizenship.
Trop filed suit in US federal courts seeking declaratory judgment that he was a US citizen.
The US district court ruled in favor of the government, and the United States Court of Appeals for the Second Circuit upheld the decision of the district court. The Supreme court granted certiorari. The petitioner was represented by Osmond K. Fraenkel.

"FEC v. National Conservative PAC, 470 U.S. 480 (1985), was a decision by the Supreme Court of the United States striking down expenditure prohibitions of the Federal Election Campaign Act of 1971 (FECA), which regulates the fundraising and spending in political campaigns. The FECA is the primary law that places regulations on campaign financing by limiting the amount that may be contributed. The Act established that no independent political action committee may contribute more than $1,000 to any given presidential candidate in support of a campaign.
A political action committee is an organization that oversees contributions made by members for an electoral candidate. The committee then donates the funding to campaign for or against a candidate.
The Democratic Party of the United States and the Federal Election Commission (FEC) accused the National Conservative Political Action Committee (NCPAC) of violating the Federal Election Campaign Act in 1975. The defendants were accused of violating the expenditure limit implemented by the FECA, with the assertion that the independent contribution was in violation of the Act. The NCPAC expressed concern that the FECA violated the First Amendment.
In response, The Federal Election Commission claimed that the limitation of expenditures held by the FECA was not a violation of the First Amendment. The FEC said that because it is important to protect the integrity of the Government, as well as to uphold the public's perception of integrity, the limitation was necessary and still complied with the First Amendment. The FEC believed private financing could tarnish the protection of integrity and the public's perception. The Commission also believed the FECA would not hinder individual expression, and that ample room was left to freely express oneself under the Act.
Justice William H. Rehnquist concluded in the majority opinion that an attempt to limit spending in support of a presidential candidate, regardless of financial numerical amount, is still an attempt to regulate the First Amendment and the freedom of association, and is therefore unconstitutional.",wiki

The Court had previously ruled in Monell v. Department of Social Services of the City of New York, 436 U.S. 658 (1978), that municipalities could only be liable under Section 1983 if the injury was a result of that municipality's ""policy or custom.""  In Los Angeles County v. Humphries, the Court ruled that this ""policy or custom"" requirement applied regardless of whether the relief the plaintiff sought was monetary or prospective.",wiki
"Poe v. Ullman, 367 U.S. 497 (1961), was a United States Supreme Court case, seeking pre-enforcement review, that held in the majority that plaintiffs (because the law had never been enforced) lacked standing to challenge a Connecticut law that banned the use of contraceptives and banned doctors from advising their use. Therefore, any challenge to the law was deemed unripe because there was no actual threat of injury to anyone who disobeyed the law. The same statute would be challenged again (this time successfully) just five years later in Griswold v. Connecticut.
The Supreme Court cites the fact that the law prohibiting use of contraceptives had been on the books since 1879 and that during the near-century of its having been enacted, only one prosecution, in 1940, was ever initiated. Furthermore, the Court cites the fact that Connecticut drug stores openly sold contraceptives, and such an act invited enforcement far more than the private conduct being sued to allow, thus Connecticut is really not enforcing the law and the mere existence of the law does not give the Supreme Court cause to exercise its judicial review.",wiki

"Bowers v. Hardwick, 478 U.S. 186 (1986), was a landmark decision of the U.S. Supreme Court that upheld, in a 5–4 ruling, the constitutionality of a Georgia sodomy law criminalizing oral and anal sex in private between consenting adults, in this case with respect to homosexual sodomy, though the law did not differentiate between homosexual and heterosexual sodomy. It was overturned in Lawrence v. Texas (2003), though the statute had already been struck down by the Georgia Supreme Court in 1998.  
The majority opinion, by Justice Byron White, reasoned that the U.S. Constitution did not confer ""a fundamental right to engage in homosexual sodomy"". A concurring opinion by Chief Justice Warren E. Burger cited the ""ancient roots"" of prohibitions against homosexual sex, quoting William Blackstone's description of homosexual sex as an ""infamous crime against nature"", worse than rape, and ""a crime not fit to be named"". Burger concluded: ""To hold that the act of homosexual sodomy is somehow protected as a fundamental right would be to cast aside millennia of moral teaching."" 
The senior dissent, by Justice Harry Blackmun, framed the issue as revolving around the right to privacy. Blackmun's dissent accused the Court of an ""almost obsessive focus on homosexual activity"" and an ""overall refusal to consider the broad principles that have informed our treatment of privacy in specific cases."" In response to invocations of religious taboos against homosexuality, Blackmun wrote: ""That certain, but by no means all, religious groups condemn the behavior at issue gives the State no license to impose their judgments on the entire citizenry. The legitimacy of secular legislation depends, instead, on whether the State can advance some justification for its law beyond its conformity to religious doctrine.""
Scholarly examinations of the case overwhelmingly sided with the dissenting minority. Some of the justices, including Lewis F. Powell, later said that they should not have joined the majority, although Powell also indicated in 1990 that the decision was of little importance. Seventeen years after Bowers, the Supreme Court directly overruled its decision in Lawrence v. Texas, holding that anti-sodomy laws are unconstitutional. In Lawrence, the Supreme Court subsequently based its decision on the American tradition of non-interference with private sexual decisions between consenting adults and on the notions of personal autonomy to define one's own relationships.",wiki

In so doing, the Supreme Court affirmed the rejection of an application for a patent on a method of hedging losses in one segment of the energy industry by making investments in other segments of that industry, on the basis that the abstract investment strategy set forth in the application was not patentable subject matter.",wiki
"Ontario v. Quon, 560 U.S. 746 (2010), is a United States Supreme Court case concerning the extent to which the right to privacy applies to electronic communications in a government workplace. It was an appeal by the city of Ontario, California, from a Ninth Circuit decision holding that it had violated the Fourth Amendment rights of two of its police officers when it disciplined them following an audit of pager text messages that discovered many of those messages were personal in nature, some sexually explicit. The Court unanimously held that the audit was work-related and thus did not violate the Fourth Amendment's protections against unreasonable search and seizure.
Ontario police sergeant Jeff Quon, along with other officers and those they were exchanging messages with, had sued the city, their superiors and the pager service provider in federal court. They had alleged a violation of not only their constitutional rights but federal telecommunications privacy laws. Their defense was that a superior officer had promised the pager messages themselves would not be audited if the officers reimbursed the city for fees it incurred when they exceeded a monthly character limit.
Justice Anthony Kennedy wrote the majority opinion signed by seven of his fellow justices. It decided the case purely on the reasonableness of the pager audit, explicitly refusing to consider ""far-reaching issues"" it raised on the grounds that modern communications technology and its role in society was still evolving. He nevertheless discussed those issues at some length in explaining why the Court chose not to rule on them, in addition to responding, for argument's sake, more directly to issues raised by the respondents. John Paul Stevens wrote a separate concurring opinion, as did Antonin Scalia, who would have used a different test he had proposed in an earlier case to reach the same result.
Outside commentators mostly praised the justices for this display of restraint, but Scalia criticized it harshly in his concurrence, calling it vague. He considered his fellow justices in ""disregard of duty"" for their refusal to address the Fourth Amendment issues. A month after the court handed down its decision, an appellate court in Georgia similarly criticized it for ""a marked lack of clarity"" as it narrowed an earlier ruling to remove a finding that there was no expectation of privacy in the contents of email. An article in The New York Times later summarized this criticism, and its ""faux unanimity"", as emblematic of what some judges and lawyers have found an increasingly frustrating trend in Roberts Court opinions.",wiki

In the late 19th and early 20th centuries, eleven southern states established poll taxes as part of their disenfranchisement of most blacks and many poor whites. The Twenty-fourth Amendment to the United States Constitution (1964) prohibited poll taxes in federal elections; five states (Alabama, Arkansas, Mississippi, Texas and Virginia) continued to require poll taxes for voters in state elections. By this ruling, the Supreme Court banned the use of poll taxes in state elections.

"Shaw v. Reno, 509 U.S. 630 (1993), was a landmark United States Supreme Court case in the area of redistricting and racial gerrymandering. After the 1990 census, North Carolina qualified to have a 12th district and drew it in a distinct snake-like manner to create a ""majority-minority"" Black district. From there, Ruth O. Shaw sued to challenge this proposed plan with the argument that this 12th district was unconstitutional and violated the Fourteenth Amendment under the clause of equal protection. In contrast, Reno, the Attorney General, argued that the district would allow for minority groups to have a voice in elections. In the decision, the court ruled in a 5–4 majority that redistricting based on race must be held to a standard of strict scrutiny under the equal protection clause and on the basis that it violated the Fourteenth Amendment because it was drawn solely based on race.
Shaw v. Reno was an influential case and received backlash. Some southern states filed against majority-Black districts. This decision played a role in deciding many future cases, including Bush v. Vera and Miller v. Johnson. However, the phrasing of irregularly drawn districts has left room for much interpretation, letting judges use their opinions rather than relying on Shaw.",wiki

The purchase was challenged in court by a neighboring resident and was blocked by the Supreme Court of Missouri before going to the U.S. Supreme Court on appeal.
In an opinion joined in by all participating justices, U.S. Supreme Court Chief Justice Fred Vinson held that the Fourteenth Amendment's Equal Protection Clause prohibits racially restrictive housing covenants from being enforced. Vinson held that while private parties could abide by the terms of a racially restrictive covenant, judicial enforcement of the covenant by a court qualified as a state action and was thus prohibited by the Equal Protection Clause.",wiki

"Microsoft Corp. v. AT&T Corp., 550 U.S. 437 (2007), was a United States Supreme Court case in which the Supreme Court reversed a previous decision by the Federal Circuit and ruled in favor of Microsoft, holding that Microsoft was not liable for infringement on AT&T's patent under 35 U.S.C. § 271(f).
In this case, Microsoft exported abroad the ""master version"" of its Windows software disk, which incorporated a speech processing function claimed by one of AT&T's patents, with the intent that such software be copied abroad for installation onto foreign-manufactured computers.
According to the Supreme Court, liability for such unauthorized replication and installation would have to arise under the patent laws of those foreign countries, not the U.S. Patent Act. Although AT&T argued that the Supreme Court's decision actually created a ""loophole"" for software makers to avoid liability under § 271(f), the Supreme Court explained that it is Congress, not the Court, that is responsible for addressing any such loopholes.

"Montana v. United States, 450 U.S. 544 (1981), was a Supreme Court case that addressed two issues: (1) Whether the title of the Big Horn Riverbed rested with the United States, in trust for the Crow Tribe or passed to the State of Montana upon becoming a state and (2) Whether Crow Tribe retained the power to regulate hunting and fishing on tribal lands owned in fee-simple by a non-tribal member. First, the Court held that Montana held title to the Big Horn Riverbed because the Equal Footing Doctrine required the United States to pass title to the newly incorporated State. Second, the Court held that Crow Tribe lacked the power to regulate nonmember hunting and fishing on fee-simple land owned by nonmembers, but within the bounds of its reservation. More broadly, the Court held that Tribes could not exercise regulatory authority over nonmembers on fee-simple land within the reservation unless (1) the nonmember entered a ""consensual relationship"" with the Tribe or its members or (2) the nonmember's ""conduct threatens or has some direct effect on the political integrity, the economic security, or the health or welfare of the tribe.""

"Holder v. Humanitarian Law Project, 561 U.S. 1 (2010), was a case decided in June 2010 by the Supreme Court of the United States regarding the Patriot Act's prohibition on providing material support to foreign terrorist organizations (18 U.S.C. § 2339B). The case, petitioned by United States Attorney General Eric Holder, represents one of only two times in First Amendment jurisprudence that a restriction on political speech has overcome strict scrutiny. The other is Williams-Yulee v. Florida Bar.
The Supreme Court ruled against the Humanitarian Law Project, which sought to help the Kurdistan Workers' Party in Turkey and Sri Lanka's Liberation Tigers of Tamil Eelam learn how to resolve conflicts peacefully. It concluded that the US Congress had intended to prevent aid to such groups, even for the purpose of facilitating peace negotiations or United Nations processes because that assistance fit the law's definition of material aid as ""training,"" ""expert advice or assistance,"" ""service,"" and ""personnel."" The finding was based on the principle that any assistance could help to ""legitimate"" the terrorist organization and free up its resources for terrorist activities.
The court noted that the proposed actions of the Humanitarian Law Project were general and ""entirely hypothetical"" and implied that a post-enforcement challenge to the application of the ""material support"" provisions was not prevented.",wiki

Singer effectuated the conspiracy by agreeing with the two European competitors to broaden US patent rights and concentrate them under Sanger's control in order to more effectively exclude the Japanese firms.

"Marino v. Ortiz, 484 U.S. 301 (1988), was a United States Supreme Court case which resulted from a lawsuit filed by 350 New York City police officers that pitted the Equal Protection Clause of the Fourteenth Amendment against Title VII of the Civil Rights Act of 1964.
The case originated with a lawsuit filed by African American and Hispanic advocacy groups (including the Puerto Rican Legal Defense and Education Fund) alleging that a police sergeant's examination had a disparate impact because the percentage of African Americans and Hispanics that passed the examination was disproportionate to overall percentage. A proposed settlement was reached between the plaintiffs and the city of New York; all of the officers eligible for promotion based on their score would be promoted as well as enough additional minorities to achieve a proportional outcome. The settlement was approved by the United States District Court for the Southern District of New York as a ""consent decree"" on an interim basis pending a hearing on its fairness and adequacy.
After the ruling but before the hearing, 350 police officers filed suit in the same court alleging that the settlement had deprived them of equal protection of the laws under the Fourteenth Amendment. These officers were not eligible for promotion based on their scores, but they scored at least as high as the lowest scoring minority promoted under the terms of the consent decree. However, they did not seek to become party to the lawsuit that originated the settlement. The consent decree was ultimately approved, and as a result the police officers' lawsuit was dismissed. They appealed both the dismissal of their lawsuit and the consent decree itself.
When oral arguments for the case were held in the fall of 1987, the Court had only eight members. Justice Lewis F. Powell, Jr. had retired from the court earlier in the year, the Senate had rejected Robert Bork's confirmation two months prior, and Anthony Kennedy would not be confirmed until after the decision was announced. This resulted in a gridlock 4-4 tie vote in the matter of whether the officers were correct to file a separate suit challenging the settlement. This being the case, the lower court ruling dismissing the suit was affirmed, but no precedent was set. The next case on the point, Martin v. Wilkes, Justice Kennedy voted that intervention was permissive (F.R.C.P. 24), not mandatory (F.R.C.P. 19) and that it was not an invalid collateral attack on the existing settlement in a similar case. Thereafter Congress amended the rules making intervention in such Title VII cases mandatory.
The Court unanimously agreed that the officers could not appeal the consent decree directly, because ""only parties to a lawsuit, or those that properly become parties, may appeal an adverse judgment.""
Though the Court's ruling did not directly address the constitutional issues raised, it foreshadowed a legal battle to come. Sonia Sotomayor, a future Supreme Court appointee by Barack Obama, promoted the minority officers' cause while at the Puerto Rican Legal Defense and Education Fund and would later rule against white plaintiffs in a similar case, Ricci v. DeStefano, in a decision that the Supreme Court would overturn by a 5–4 vote.",wiki

"District of Columbia v. Heller, 554 U.S. 570 (2008), is a landmark decision of the Supreme Court of the United States. It ruled that the Second Amendment to the U.S. Constitution protects an individual's right to keep and bear arms—unconnected with service in a militia—for traditionally lawful purposes such as self-defense within the home, and that the District of Columbia's handgun ban and requirement that lawfully owned rifles and shotguns be kept ""unloaded and disassembled or bound by a trigger lock"" violated this guarantee. It also stated that the right to bear arms is not unlimited and that certain restrictions on guns and gun ownership were permissible. It was the first Supreme Court case to decide whether the Second Amendment protects an individual right to keep and bear arms for self-defense or whether the right was only intended for state militias.
Because of the District of Columbia's status as a federal enclave (it is not in any U.S. state), the decision did not address the question of whether the Second Amendment's protections are incorporated by the Due Process Clause of the Fourteenth Amendment to the U.S. Constitution against the states. This point was addressed two years later by McDonald v. City of Chicago (2010), in which it was found that they are.
On June 26, 2008, the Supreme Court affirmed by a vote of 5 to 4 the U.S. Court of Appeals for the D.C. Circuit in Heller v. District of Columbia. The Supreme Court struck down provisions of the Firearms Control Regulations Act of 1975 as unconstitutional, determined that handguns are ""arms"" for the purposes of the Second Amendment, found that the Regulations Act was an unconstitutional ban, and struck down the portion of the Act that requires all firearms including rifles and shotguns be kept ""unloaded and disassembled or bound by a trigger lock"".

Congress assigned the responsibility of conducting an ""actual enumeration"" of the American society to the Secretary of Commerce, who in the 1990 census, decided not to implement the statistical correction, better known as the post-enumeration survey (PES) to adjust an undercount in the initial population count.
Furthermore, following several citizens' groups, states, and cities, Wisconsin disputed the Secretary's decision not to use PES declaring that it resulted in an undercounting of certain identifiable minority groups.",wiki
"Planned Parenthood v. Casey, 505 U.S. 833 (1992), was a landmark decision of the Supreme Court of the United States in which the Court upheld the right to have an abortion as established by the ""essential holding"" of Roe v. Wade (1973) and issued as its ""key judgment"" the restoration of the undue burden standard when evaluating state-imposed restrictions on that right. Both the essential holding of Roe and the key judgment of Casey were overturned by the Supreme Court in 2022, with its landmark decision in Dobbs v. Jackson Women's Health Organization.
The case arose from a challenge to five provisions of the Pennsylvania Abortion Control Act of 1982; among the provisions were requirements for a waiting period, spousal notice, and (for minors) parental consent prior to undergoing an abortion procedure. In a plurality opinion jointly written by associate justices Sandra Day O'Connor, Anthony Kennedy, and David Souter, the Supreme Court upheld the ""essential holding"" of Roe, which was that the Due Process Clause of the Fourteenth Amendment to the United States Constitution protected a woman's right to have an abortion prior to fetal viability.
The Court overturned the Roe trimester framework in favor of a viability analysis, thereby allowing states to implement abortion restrictions that apply during the first trimester of pregnancy. In its ""key judgment,"" the Court overturned Roe's strict scrutiny standard of review of a state's abortion restrictions with the undue burden standard, under which abortion restrictions would be unconstitutional when they were enacted for ""the purpose or effect of placing a substantial obstacle in the path of a woman seeking an abortion of a nonviable fetus."" Applying this new standard of review, the Court upheld four provisions of the Pennsylvania law, but invalidated the requirement of spousal notification. Four justices wrote or joined opinions arguing that Roe v. Wade should have been struck down, while two justices wrote opinions favoring the preservation of the higher standard of review for abortion restrictions.",wiki

This matters because the answer determines whether a defendant can be retried. Ordinarily, a defendant who requests a mistrial can be forced to stand trial a second time, see United States v. Dinitz. However, if the prosecution's conduct was ""intended to provoke the defendant into moving for a mistrial,"" double jeopardy protects the defendant from retrial.

The local tribal council in Venetie, Alaska, wanted to collect tax from non-tribal members doing business on tribal lands. The Supreme Court granted certiorari on appeal from the United States Court of Appeals for the Ninth Circuit, which had ruled in the tribe's favor, saying they occupied Indian Country.
The Court decided unanimously that the land was not the tribe's land subject to the tribal tax, even though it was owned by the tribe, because it was not part of a Native American reservation. Because all but one reservation in Alaska (the Annette Island reservation of the Tsimshian) had been eliminated by the Alaska Native Claims Settlement Act of 1971, the decision had the practical effect of prohibiting almost all Indian tribes in Alaska from collecting taxes for activities conducted on tribal land.

"Barefoot v. Estelle, 463 U.S. 880 (1983), is a United States Supreme Court case. The Court ruled on the admissibility of clinical opinions given by two psychiatrists hired by the prosecution in answer to hypothetical questions regarding the defendant's future dangerousness and the likelihood that he would present a continuing threat to society in this Texas death penalty case. The American Psychiatric Association submitted an amicus curiae brief in support of the defendant's position that such testimony should be inadmissible and urging curtailment of psychiatric testimony regarding future dangerousness and a prohibition of such testimony based on hypothetical data.
In Estelle v. Smith, 451 U.S. 454 (1981), the Supreme Court previously ruled on a Texas death penalty case regarding the use of a psychiatric examination to determine the defendant's competency to stand trial to predict future dangerousness.  In that case the Court held that the Fifth Amendment's privilege against self-incrimination applied to pretrial psychiatric examinations by a prosecution psychiatrist who later testified regarding the defendant's future dangerousness without warning the defendant that such evidence could be used against him. The Court reasoned that although a defendant has no generalized constitutional right to remain silent at a psychiatric examination limited to the issues of sanity or competency, full Miranda warnings must be given with respect to testimony concerning future dangerousness.",wiki

"Runyon v. McCrary, 427 U.S. 160 (1976), was a landmark case by the United States Supreme Court, which ruled that private schools that discriminate on the basis of race or establish racial segregation are in violation of federal law. Whereas Brown v. Board of Education barred segregation by public schools, this case barred segregation in private schools. This decision is built on Jones v. Alfred H. Mayer Co. another landmark civil rights case that affirmed the federal government's ability to penalize racist acts by private actors.
Dissenting Justices Byron White and William Rehnquist (who allegedly opposed Brown v. Board of Education for parts of his life) argued that the legislative history of 42 U.S.C. § 1981 (popularly known as the Civil Rights Act of 1866) indicated that the Act was not designed to prohibit private racial discrimination, but only state-sponsored racial discrimination (as had been held in the Civil Rights Cases of 1883).",wiki

"Rosenberger v. Rector and Visitors of the University of Virginia, 515 U.S. 819 (1995), was an opinion by the Supreme Court of the United States regarding whether a state university might, consistent with the First Amendment, withhold from student religious publications funding provided to similar secular student publications. The University of Virginia provided funding to every student organization that met funding-eligibility criteria, which Wide Awake, the student religious publication, fulfilled. The University's defense claimed that denying student activity funding to the religious magazine was necessary to avoid the University's violating the Establishment Clause of the First Amendment.
The Supreme Court disagreed with the University; constitutional law scholar Michael W. McConnell argued on behalf of the student religious publication, and John Calvin Jeffries argued on behalf of the University of Virginia. The decision centered on the Memorial and Remonstrance Against Religious Assessments, a document on religious freedom by James Madison.

The California insurance program at issue did not exclude workers from eligibility based on sex but excluded pregnancy from a list of compensable disabilities. The majority found that even though only women would be directly affected by the administrative decision, the classification of normal pregnancy as non-compensable was not a sex-based classification and so the court would defer to the state so long as it could provide a rational basis for its categorization.",wiki
"Cleveland Board of Education v. Loudermill, 470 U.S. 532 (1985), was a United States Supreme Court case in which the Court held that:

certain public-sector employees can  have a property interest in their employment, per Constitutional Due Process. See Board of Regents v. Roth
this property right entails a right to ""some kind of hearing"" before being terminated—a  right to oral or written notice of charges against them, an explanation of the employer's evidence, and an opportunity to present their sides of the story.
thus, the pretermination hearing should be an initial check against mistaken decisions—not a full evidentiary hearing, but essentially a determination of whether there are reasonable grounds to believe that the charges against the employee are true and support the proposed action.
in this case, because the respondents alleged that they had no chance to respond, the District Court erred in dismissing for failure to state a claim.
As a result of the case, public sector employers are required to provide a Loudermill hearing and/or a Loudermill letter before terminating an employee.

This case addressed the Clean Air Act (CAA) and two of its programs, Prevention of Significant Deterioration (PSD) and New Source Performance Standard (NSPS). PSD applies to regulating annual emissions; NSPS pertains to regulating hourly emissions, although the defendants argued that the hourly emissions of their facilities remained unchanged. Each section of the Clean Air Act, that outlines the provisions of the PSD and the NSPS, defines ""modification"" differently. As a result, the inconsistency of the term ""modification"" in the CAA becomes the main debate of the case and the main argument for both the plaintiffs and defendants.",wiki

"Beacon Theatres, Inc. v. Westover, 359 U.S. 500 (1959), was a case decided by the Supreme Court of the United States dealing with jury trials in civil matters.  The court held that where legal and equitable claims are joined in the same action, the legal claims must be tried by a jury before the equitable claims can be resolved.
Cornell Law School's Legal Information Institute summarized it like this:

In Beacon Theatres v. Westover, the Court held that a district court erred in trying all issues itself in an action in which the plaintiff sought a declaratory judgment and an injunction barring the defendant from instituting an antitrust action against it, and the defendant had filed a counterclaim alleging violation of the antitrust laws and asking for treble damages. It did not matter, the Court ruled, that the equitable claims had been filed first and the law counterclaims involved allegations common to the equitable claims. Subsequent jury trial of these issues would probably be precluded by collateral estoppel, hence ""only under the most imperative circumstances which in view of the flexible procedures of the Federal Rules we cannot now anticipate, can the right to a jury trial of legal issues be lost through prior determination of equitable claims.""
The question was whether the exclusive agreement of Fox Theatres with the distributor Westover for first-run movies was reasonable.",wiki

"14 Penn Plaza LLC v. Pyett, 556 U.S. 247 (2009), is a United States labor law case decided by the United States Supreme Court on the rights of unionized workers to sue their employer for age discrimination. In this 2009 decision, the Court decided that whenever a union contract ""clearly and unmistakably"" requires that all age discrimination claims under the Age Discrimination in Employment Act of 1967 (ADEA) be decided through arbitration, then employees subject to that contract cannot have those claims heard in court.
Pyett's lawyers, in addition to arguing that a union could not legally bargain away an employee's right to pursue an ADEA claim in court, also argued that ""the facts… [show that the union] Local32BJ… has not done so in this case."" However, because these arguments had not been raised in the lower courts, the Supreme Court chose not to consider them and decided that the Collective Bargaining Agreement in this case did mandate that the employees' ADEA claims had to be resolved through arbitration.
Prior to the Supreme Court's decision in 14 Penn Plaza v. Pyett, employees who were covered under union contracts, often referred to as bargaining unit members, had been able to raise any claims of civil rights violations by their employer in court.

"Southland Corp. v. Keating, 465 U.S. 1 (1984), is a United States Supreme Court decision concerning arbitration. It was originally brought by 7-Eleven franchisees in California state courts, alleging breach of contract by the chain's then parent corporation. Southland pointed to the arbitration clauses in their franchise agreements and said it required disputes to be resolved that way; the franchisees cited state franchising law voiding any clause in an agreement that required franchisees to waive their rights under that law. A 7-2 majority held that the Federal Arbitration Act (FAA) applied to contracts executed under state law.
Chief Justice Warren Burger wrote for the majority that it was clearly the intent of Congress in passing the FAA to encourage the use of arbitration as widely as possible, that it enacted ""a national policy favoring arbitration."" Justice Sandra Day O'Connor dissented, along with William Rehnquist, arguing that the legislative history of the FAA strongly suggested it was intended to apply only to contracts executed under federal law. In later years, Clarence Thomas would make those arguments the foundation of a series of dissents from cases concerning the application of the FAA to state law, even in cases for which O'Connor decided with the majority, citing stare decisis.
The decision was a turning point in the use of arbitration in American contract law, as it was followed with other decisions limiting the authority of states to regulate arbitration. It has been described as ""perhaps the most controversial case in the Supreme Court's history of arbitration jurisprudence."" Its legal foundation has been examined and disputed, and some critics have found the FAA's legislative history directly contradicts the court's holding. One scholar has even found the decision an unconstitutional infringement of states' power over their own courts. Mandatory prebinding arbitration clauses became widespread, particularly in credit card agreements and other consumer services. Proponents of arbitration pointed to its success in reducing crowded court dockets, but consumer advocates charged that the arbitration process was biased in favor of large corporations and against consumers, many of whom were far poorer and legally unsophisticated. They would be joined in calling unsuccessfully for it to be overturned in a later case by 20 state attorneys general.",wiki

Harris, 550 U.S. 372 (2007), was a decision by the Supreme Court of the United States involving a lawsuit against a sheriff's deputy brought by a motorist who was paralyzed after the officer ran his eluding vehicle off the road during a high-speed car chase. The driver contended that this action was an unreasonable seizure under the Fourth Amendment. The case also involved the question of whether a police officer's qualified immunity shielded him from suit under Section 1983. On April 30, 2007, in an 8–1 decision, the court sided with police and ruled that a ""police officer's attempt to terminate a dangerous high-speed car chase that threatens the lives of innocent bystanders does not violate the Fourth Amendment, even when it places the fleeing motorist at risk of serious injury or death."" In a rare occurrence, the court accepted the presentation of video evidence of the high-speed pursuit. Such procedure is quite uncommon in the Supreme Court and was viewed as part of an interesting relationship between the Supreme Court and technology. The video had a strong effect on the Court's decision and is viewed as a major factor in how the court made its decision.  The author of the opinion, Justice Antonin Scalia, in a first-time occurrence ever, posted the video of the car chase online (for access to the video, see external links below).
Justice John Paul Stevens, the lone dissenter, argued that the videotape evidence was not decisive, as the majority claimed it to be, and that a jury should determine if deadly force was justified. He stated a jury should be used, instead of the case ""being decided by a group of elderly appellate judges,"" a reference to himself and his colleagues on the court (this sentence is not in the text of the dissent, but he pronounced it while reading the opinion at bench).
Three law professors created an experiment based on the video, showing it to over a thousand subjects and then asking them whether they thought the use of deadly force was reasonable.

"Connick v. Myers, 461 U.S. 138 (1983), is a United States Supreme Court decision concerning the First Amendment rights of public employees who speak on matters of possible public concern within the workplace context. It was first brought by Sheila Myers, an Orleans Parish, Louisiana, assistant district attorney (ADA). She had been fired by her superior, District Attorney Harry Connick Sr., when, after receiving a transfer she had fiercely resisted in private conversations with him and his chief assistant district attorney, she distributed a questionnaire to her fellow prosecutors asking about their experience with Connick's management practices. At trial, Judge Jack Gordon of the Eastern District of Louisiana found the firing had been motivated by the questionnaire and was thus an infringement on her right to speak out on matters of public concern as a public employee. After the Fifth Circuit affirmed the verdict, Connick appealed to the Supreme Court.
The justices reversed the lower courts by a 5–4 margin. Justice Byron White wrote for the majority that most of the matters Myers' questionnaire had touched on were of personal, not public, concern and that the action had damaged the harmonious relations necessary for the efficient operation of the district attorney's office. William Brennan argued in dissent that the majority's application of precedent was flawed. He argued that all the matters in the questionnaire were of public concern, and feared a  chilling effect on speech by public employees about such matters would result.
The case was the first in a line considering the right of public employees to speak contemporaneously with their employment that had started with Pickering v. Board of Education (1968) fifteen years earlier in which the Court sided with the employee. It introduced the test of whether the employee's speech had been on matters of public concern to the balancing of employer and employee interest prescribed in the earlier case. The two would guide the Court's interpretation of later cases such as Rankin v. McPherson (1987). In the 1990s and 2000s, Waters v. Churchill (1994) and Garcetti v.

"Townsend v. Sain, 372 U.S. 293 (1963), was a United States Supreme Court case wherein the Court expanded the circumstances in which federal courts should hold evidentiary hearings when presented with petitions for habeas corpus by state prisoners following denial of postconviction relief in state court. The Court held that federal district courts must hold evidentiary hearings if the state court did not resolve all material factual disputes in a full and fair hearing supported by the record.
The case centered around Charles Townsend, who was convicted of a series of murders and robberies and sentenced to death. The issue heard in the Supreme Court centered around a confession Townsend had given while under the influence of an alleged ""truth serum"". Townsend's attorneys argued that the effects of the truth serum had made the confession inadmissible. Townsend appealed the case by filing a writ of habeas corpus against Sheriff Frank G. Sain of Cook County, Illinois. The case made it to Illinois Supreme Court once, and the Supreme Court twice: first in 1959 and again in 1963. The appeals case however did not revolve around the truth serum, but instead procedural questions surrounding a prisoner's right to an evidentiary hearing during the appeal process. 
The court held that Townsend's writ of habeas corpus should not have been summarily denied, and that the lower court should have held an evidentiary hearing to determine the veracity of Townsend's claims. The court repeated its previous decision that coerced confessions were inadmissible, and theorized that a confession via truth serum would thus be inadmissible; the court was careful to avoid saying whether or not Townsend had actually been given a truth serum.
Alongside Fay v. Noia and Sanders v. United States, Townsend is cited as revolutionizing and greatly expanding the use of habeas corpus, leading to it being used as a general purpose appeals tool. However a variety of Supreme Court decisions since then have narrowed its application.",wiki

"Tennessee Valley Authority v. Hiram Hill et al., or TVA v. Hill, 437 U.S. 153 (1978), was a United States Supreme Court case and the Court's first interpretation of the Endangered Species Act of 1973.  After the discovery of the snail darter fish in the Little Tennessee River in August 1973, a lawsuit was filed alleging that the Tennessee Valley Authority (TVA)'s Tellico Dam construction was in violation of the Endangered Species Act.  Plaintiffs argued dam construction would destroy critical habitat and endanger the population of snail darters.  It was decided by a 6-3 vote, in which the U.S. Supreme Court ruled in favor of Hill, et al. and granted an injunction stating that there would be conflict between Tellico Dam operation and the explicit provisions of Section 7 of the Endangered Species Act.
The majority opinion, delivered by Chief Justice Warren E. Burger, affirmed the Sixth Circuit Court of Appeals decision in granting an injunction.  This decision by the Supreme Court to not allow exemptions confirmed that Section 7 of the Endangered Species Act was a strong substantive provision and helped shape federal environmental law.   The case is commonly cited as an example of the strict construction-plain meaning canon of construction, and the equitable principle that courts cannot balance equities to override statutory mandates unless on constitutional grounds.",wiki
"Ricci v. DeStefano, 557 U.S. 557 (2009), is a United States labor law case of the United States Supreme Court on unlawful discrimination through disparate impact under the Civil Rights Act of 1964.
Twenty city firefighters at the New Haven Fire Department,  nineteen white and one Hispanic, passed the test for promotion to a management position, yet the city declined to promote them because none of the black firefighters who took the same test scored high enough to be considered for promotion. New Haven officials invalidated the test results because they feared a lawsuit over the test's disproportionate exclusion of a certain racial group (blacks) from promotion under a disparate impact cause of action. The twenty non-black firefighters claimed discrimination under Title VII of the Civil Rights Act of 1964.
The Supreme Court held 5–4 that New Haven's decision to ignore the test results violated Title VII because the city did not have a ""strong basis in evidence"" that it would have subjected itself to disparate impact liability if it had promoted the white and Hispanic firefighters instead of the black firefighters. Because the plaintiffs won under their Title VII claim, the Court did not consider the plaintiffs' argument that New Haven violated the constitutional right to equal protection.",wiki

"Schenck v. Pro-Choice Network of Western New York, 519 U.S. 357 (1997), was a case heard before the United States Supreme Court related to legal protection of access to abortion. The question before the court was whether the First Amendment was violated by placing an injunction on protesters outside abortion clinics. The court ruled in a 6–3 decision that ""floating buffer zones"" preventing protesters approaching people entering or leaving the clinics were unconstitutional, though ""fixed buffer zones"" around the clinics themselves remained constitutional. The Court's upholding the fixed buffer was the most important aspect of the ruling, because it was a common feature of injunctions nationwide.
Paul Schenck challenged a Federal District Court injunction that restricted ""sidewalk counselors"" from approaching abortion clinic patients and others with Bibles, tracts and anti-abortion messages. Because these protesters often violently harassed and intimidated patients and staff or prevented them from entering the clinic, the Court upheld the fixed buffer zone around the clinics, although it struck down the floating buffer zone around individuals because its indefinite and movable nature made it difficult to administer and risked overly restricting free speech.",wiki

Petitioner Lloyd E. Schlup, Jr., a Missouri prisoner under a sentence of death for the 1984 murder of an inmate named Arthur Dade, filed a habeas corpus petition alleging that constitutional error deprived the jury of critical evidence that would have established his innocence. At trial, the state's evidence consisted of the testimony of two corrections officers who had witnessed the murder. Schlup's defense was that the videotape from a camera in the dining room showed that he was not the man that killed Arthur Dade. Schlup was denied his federal habeas corpus petition and filed a second petition alleging ineffective counsel. However, he did not argue his ineffective counsel claim in his first habeas corpus petition. Due to this, he was procedurally barred from arguing his case unless he could show that he was actually innocent and his conviction would be a miscarriage of justice. The Court granted certiorari to consider whether the Sawyer v. Whitley standard provides adequate protection against the kind of miscarriage of justice that would result from the execution of a person who is actually innocent.",wiki

The Court found the statute vague, meaning it was written in a manner that almost anyone could be convicted of the statute by engaging in most legal activities.  However, the Court refused to void the statute as unconstitutionally vague.  The Court decided to limit the application of the statute only to defendants who hold a fiduciary duty and they participate in bribery and kickback schemes.

"Penry v. Lynaugh, 492 U.S. 302 (1989), was a United States Supreme Court case that sanctioned the death penalty for mentally disabled offenders because the Court determined executing the mentally disabled was not ""cruel and unusual punishment"" under the Eighth Amendment. However, because Texas law did not allow the jury to give adequate consideration as a mitigating factor to Johnny Paul Penry's intellectual disability at the sentencing phase of his murder trial, the Court remanded the case for further proceedings. Eventually, Penry was retried for capital murder, again sentenced to death, and again the Supreme Court ruled, in Penry v. Johnson, that the jury was not able to adequately consider Penry's intellectual disability as a mitigating factor at the sentencing phase of the trial. Ultimately, Penry was spared the death penalty because of the Supreme Court's ruling in Atkins v. Virginia, which, while not directly  overruling the holding in ""Penry I"", did give considerable negative treatment to Penry on the basis that the Eighth Amendment allowed execution of mentally disabled people.",wiki
"PUD No. 1 of Jefferson County v. Washington Department of Ecology, 511 U.S. 700 (1994), is a case decided by the United States Supreme Court that interpreted section 401 of the Clean Water Act. The case involved an application by the Jefferson County Public Utility District and Tacoma City Light in northwestern Washington to build a hydropower facility on the Dosewallips River, first proposed in 1982 and known as the ""Elkhorn Dam"" project. The Washington State Department of Ecology issued a certification to the project in 1986 that imposed minimum water flow requirements to protect species of salmon and steelhead under the federal Clean Water Act. Tacoma City Light argued that the dam project would only need to adhere to minimum flow standards set by the Federal Energy Regulatory Commission (FERC), who license dams. Environmentalist groups argued that the FERC was insensitive to recreation and protection of salmon and steelhead and asked the state to enforce its minimum flow standards.

"Harmelin v. Michigan, 501 U.S. 957 (1991), was a case decided by the Supreme Court of the United States under the Eighth Amendment to the United States Constitution. The Court ruled that the Eighth Amendment's Cruel and Unusual Punishment Clause allowed a state to impose a life sentence without the possibility of parole for the possession of 672 grams (23.70 oz) of cocaine.
The Court's narrow ruling left a major question of Eighth Amendment law unresolved.  Since the Court's decision in Gregg v. Georgia, the Court had incorporated a detailed proportionality analysis into the cruel and unusual punishment analysis required in capital cases. The defendant Ronald Harmelin directly asked the Court to extend the reach of that analysis to noncapital cases such as his. Although five Justices agreed that Harmelin's sentence was not unconstitutionally cruel and unusual, six Justices agreed that the Cruel and Unusual Punishment Clause bore some kind of proportionality analysis. Yet among those six, three supported a proportionality principle that is highly deferential to legislative judgments, while three others supported a more searching proportionality analysis that would have struck down Michigan's mandatory life-without-parole sentence for possessing more than 650 grams (22.93 oz) of cocaine (672 grams or 23.70 ounces).
The State of Michigan was represented by Richard Thompson and Michael Modelski. Thompson's other credits include serving as a prosecutor of Dr. Jack Kevorkian. Various state attorneys general, as well as the United States Solicitor General, filed amicus curiae briefs on behalf of the State of Michigan.

A narrowly divided court overturned the conviction of a Nebraska man for receiving child sexual abuse material through the mail, ruling that postal inspectors had implanted a desire to do so through repeated written entreaties.
It was the first time the court had considered an entrapment case from outside the realm of controlled-substance enforcement, or one involving conduct that had only recently been criminalized. By relying exclusively on whether the defendant had a predisposition to commit the crime, the court appeared to have finally resolved a lingering issue in its previous decisions on the subject.
The decision was seen as a rare triumph for defendants before a conservative court that frequently sided with prosecutors. Guidelines for federal law enforcement agents were changed in its wake, and it was described as having brought entrapment ""back from the dead.""",wiki

"Board of Regents of State Colleges v. Roth, 408 U.S. 564 (1972), was a case decided by the United States Supreme Court concerning alleged discrimination against a nontenured teacher at Wisconsin State University-Oshkosh.
David Roth was hired as a first year assistant professor of political science in 1968 for a fixed term of one year, with a possibility of extension on mutual consent of the parties. In accordance with procedural rules set by the Board of Regents, the president of the University informed Roth he would not be rehired for the next academic year, giving him no reason for the decision and no opportunity to challenge it in any sort of hearing. The Board's employment rules provided opportunity for review of teachers ""dismissed"" before the end of the employment term, but did not extend these protections to teachers whose contracts were simply not renewed.
Roth brought suit in federal district court alleging that he was being punished for statements he had made that were critical of the university administration. He said the decision not to rehire him infringed his First Amendment right to freedom of speech. He also alleged that the university's failure to provide a hearing violated his Fourteenth Amendment right to procedural due process of law.
In an opinion delivered by Justice Stewart, the Supreme Court held that the Fourteenth Amendment does not require an opportunity for a hearing prior to the nonrenewal of a nontenured state teacher's contract, unless he can show that the nonrenewal deprived him of an interest in ""liberty"" or that he had a ""property"" interest in continued employment, despite the lack of tenure or a formal contract.
Justice Douglas dissented, writing ""When a violation of First Amendment rights is alleged, the reasons for dismissal or for nonrenewal of an employment contract must be examined to see if the reasons given are only a cloak for activity or attitudes protected by the Constitution.""
Justice Marshall wrote a separate dissent saying that ""every citizen who applies for a government job is entitled to it unless the government can establish some reason for denying the employment."" He held government to higher scrutiny than private employers and said that government employees deserve ""fair and adequate information"" at their terminations in order to protect against arbitrary behavior.

"Schlesinger v. Ballard, 419 U.S. 498 (1975), was a United States Supreme Court case that upheld a federal statute granting female Naval officers four more years of commissioned service before mandatory discharge than male Naval officers.  A group of naval officers who were discharged prior to their tenth year of commissioned service, as a result of not being promoted, received a lower rate of separation pay than female officers who were permitted to remain in service longer and receive three additional promotion board opportunities.  As a result, the female officers who failed to be promoted received a higher rate of separation pay over their male counterparts.  Ballard, a male officer who was passed over earned $15,000 in separation pay, but if he had been a similarly situated female officer, he argued that he would have received over $200,000 in separation pay.  Ballard had also served as an enlisted sailor, but his eighteen years of total service was not enough to earn a military retirement.

"Rock v. Arkansas, 483 U.S. 44 (1987), was a Supreme Court of the United States case in which the Court held that criminal defendants have a constitutional right to testify on their own behalf.
The right of a person to represent oneself in a court of law had been recognized for a very long time prior to this case. This right has been established by both legislative enactments and judicial rulings alike. An 1864 appropriations act allowed defendants to testify for themselves. The right of a criminal defendant to represent oneself had already been recognized by courts prior to this case. In Faretta v. California, the United States Supreme Court held that criminal defendants are constitutionally free to decline or reject professional lawyers as legal representation in state-level courts as well as to serve as their own legal counsels in such trials. In that case, the Court noted the lengthy history of the right by stating:

In the federal courts, the right of self-representation has been protected by statute since the beginnings of our Nation. Section 35 of the Judiciary Act of 1789, 1 Stat. 73, 92, enacted by the First Congress and signed by President Washington one day before the Sixth Amendment was proposed, provided that ""in all the courts of the United States, the parties may plead and manage their own causes personally or by the assistance of counsel.""
The movement in favor of allowing defendants to testify for themselves was popular, but its critics worried that it would destroy the presumption of innocence because of the perception that someone who is innocent of a crime would certainly speak to defend themselves and a person who is guilty of a crime would certainly not do so. This perception is inaccurate because a defendant's past becomes broadly admissible as evidence when they take the stand, so testifying may be against their interests. For example, when an individual with a criminal record testifies in their own trial, that past record can be presented to persuade the jury that they are the kind of person who would have done what they are accused of in the present. In a sense, the critics' worries have come to pass because relevant scholarship indicates that there is a measurable difference between the conviction rates of factually-innocent people whenever they do testify or they do not testify. Juries tend to convict criminal defendants who choose to testify for themselves at higher rates; likewise, juries tend to acquit criminal defendants who decline to testify for themselves.",wiki

In the case, Hustler magazine ran a full-page parody ad against televangelist and political commentator Jerry Falwell Sr., depicting him as an incestuous drunk who had sex with his mother in an outhouse. The ad was marked as a parody that was ""not to be taken seriously"". In response, Falwell sued Hustler and the magazine's publisher Larry Flynt for intentional infliction of emotional distress, libel, and invasion of privacy, but Flynt defended the ad's publication as protected by the First Amendment.
In an 8–0 decision, the Court held that the emotional distress inflicted on Falwell by the ad was not a sufficient reason to deny the First Amendment protection to speech that is critical of public officials and public figures.

"Kunz v. New York, 340 U.S. 290 (1951), was a landmark United States Supreme Court case that held a requirement mandating a permit to speak on religious issues in public was unconstitutional. The case was argued on October 17, 1950, and decided on January 15, 1951, with an 8–1 decision. Chief Justice Vinson delivered the opinion for the Court. Justice Black and Justice Frankfurter concurred in the result only. Justice Jackson dissented.
Kunz helped establish the principle that government restrictions on speech must be narrowly tailored to avoid improperly limiting expression protected by the First Amendment. In this case, the Court held that laws granting public officials broad discretion to restrain speech about religious issues in advance constitute an invalid prior restraint, violating the First Amendment. The Court reversed the 1948 conviction of Baptist minister Carl J. Kunz, who was found guilty of violating a New York City ordinance required a permit from the police commissioner to hold religious services on public streets. Although the ordinance did not specify grounds for refusing permission, Kunz was denied permits in 1947 and 1948 after being accused of making “scurrilous attacks” on Catholics and Jews under a previous permit. He was subsequently arrested for speaking without a permit in Columbus Circle.
Kunz's conviction for violating the ordinance was upheld by the Appellate Part of the Court of Special Sessions and by the New York Court of Appeals. However, the Supreme Court ultimately ruled that New York's ordinance was overly broad because it failed to provide any standards for administrators to determine who should receive permits to speak about religious issues.
In his dissenting opinion, Justice Robert Jackson argued that Kunz had used “fighting words” that were not protected by the First Amendment (see unprotected speech). He also criticized the Court for striking down the permit scheme citing the recent case of Feiner v. New York (1951), in which the Court had allowed local officials the discretion to arrest volatile speakers during their presentations.

"Estes v. Texas, 381 U.S. 532 (1965), was a case in which the United States Supreme Court overturned the fraud conviction of petitioner Billy Sol Estes, holding that his Fourteenth Amendment due process rights had been violated by the publicity associated with the pretrial hearing, which had been carried live on both television and radio. News photography was permitted throughout the trial and parts of it were broadcast as well.
There was no doubt that the Court was displeased with the intensive pretrial and trial coverage, but its biggest concern was the presence of cameras at the two-day-long pretrial hearing. It included at least 12 still and television photographers, three microphones on the judge's bench, and several aimed at the jury's box and attorney's table. When it was time for the trial to be held, it was moved about 500 miles away and the judge had imposed rather severe restrictions on press coverage. However, the justices did mark the notion that cameras would return to courtrooms eventually: 

It is said that the ever-advancing techniques of public communication and the adjustment of the public to its presence may bring about a change in the effect of telecasting upon the fairness of criminal trials.

"Cottage Savings Association v. Commissioner, 499 U.S. 554 (1991), was an income tax case before the Supreme Court of the United States.
The Court was asked to determine whether the exchange of different participation interests in home mortgages by a savings and loan association was a ""disposition of property"" under § 1001(a) of the Internal Revenue Code (since this was the requirement for them to realize, and deduct, their losses on these mortgages).
The Court determined that it was a ""disposition of property"" by making the following three holdings:

Under § 1001(a), exchange of property gives rise to realization (a ""disposition of property"") only if the exchanged properties are ""materially different.""
This concept of ""material difference"" is not defined by an economic substitute test (whether various parties would consider their differences to be ""material""); rather, two properties are materially different if their respective possessors enjoy legal entitlements that are different in kind or extent.
The S&L's 90% participation interest in its mortgages embodied legally distinct entitlements (and so was ""materially different"" from) the 90% mortgage participation interest it received from the other savings associations. Even if mortgages are ""substantially identical"" for purposes of Federal Home Loan Bank Board ""Memorandum R-49"" on reporting losses, they can still exhibit ""material difference"" for the purposes of finding a ""disposition of property.""",wiki
"Schmuck v. United States, 489 U.S. 705 (1989), is a United States Supreme Court decision on criminal law and procedure. By a 5–4 margin it upheld the mail fraud conviction of an Illinois man and resolved a conflict among the appellate circuits over which test to use to determine if a defendant was entitled to a jury instruction allowing conviction on a lesser included charge. Justice Harry Blackmun wrote for the majority; Antonin Scalia for the dissent.
The case had begun when Schmuck was prosecuted for having rolled back odometers for years on cars he sold to used-car dealers. He had been indicted for 12 counts of mail fraud, based on the vehicle title applications the dealers had then mailed to the state's Department of Transportation in order to resell the cars. Before his trial in the Western District of Wisconsin, he had been denied a motion to have the jury instructed that they could vote to convict him of tampering with the odometer, at the time a less serious offense, if they did not find him guilty of mail fraud.
He raised the issue after his conviction with the Seventh Circuit Court of Appeals, as well as the applicability of the mail-fraud statute to the dealers' applications. A panel rejected the latter argument but agreed that the jury should have been allowed to consider the lesser charge, reversing the conviction and remanding the case for a new trial. The government appealed that decision to an en banc panel of the circuit, which restored the conviction, holding that the odometer tampering was not ""inherently related"" to the mail fraud. Since other appellate circuits had preferred a different test for lesser included charges, Schmuck successfully petitioned the Supreme Court to hear the case.
Blackmun ruled for the government on both questions. Since Schmuck had enjoyed a continuing relationship with the dealers he sold to, and the cars could not be resold to a retail customer without titles obtained using false information, the dealers' applications were an essential element of his crime and thus constituted mail fraud. On the second question, Blackmun said the court should have considered whether the elements of odometer tampering were a subset of the elements of the mail fraud, and since that was not the case Schmuck had been properly denied the instruction. Scalia's dissent focused exclusively on the mail fraud issue. Since Schmuck had already received his payment for the altered vehicles, it did not matter what happened afterwards, a holding he found more consistent with the Court's earlier rulings on the subject.",wiki
"Califano v. Goldfarb, 430 U.S. 199 (1977), was a decision by the United States Supreme Court, which held that the different treatment of men and women mandated by 42 U.S.C. § 402(f)(1)(D) constituted invidious discrimination against female wage earners by affording them less protection for their surviving spouses than is provided to male employees, and therefore violated the Due Process Clause of the Fifth Amendment to the United States Constitution. The case was brought by a widower who was denied survivor benefits on the grounds that he had not been receiving at least one-half support from his wife when she died. Justice Brennan delivered the opinion of the court, ruling unconstitutional the provision of the Social Security Act which set forth a gender-based distinction between widows and widowers, whereby Social Security Act survivors benefits were payable to a widower only if he was receiving at least half of his support from his late wife, while such benefits based on the earnings of a deceased husband were payable to his widow regardless of dependency.

Congress passed a law limiting rents in certain areas for the purposes of controlling a deficit of housing due to returning veterans which took effect July 1, 1947.  The following day a landlord demanded increased rent in a covered area of Cleveland.  Hostilities in World War II had been terminated by presidential proclamation on December 31, 1946.
The Supreme Court found the law valid under the Necessary and Proper and War Powers clauses of the Constitution.  The Court held, ""Congress has the power even after the cessation of hostilities to act to control the forces that a short supply of the needed article created."" It indicated the legislative history revealed Congress intended to use its war powers and the war was a ""direct and immediate"" cause of the problem.  The Court recognized the effects of a war may continue for years and that there might be a point at which the power to legislate to remedy effects of war would violate the Ninth and Tenth Amendments.

"Bronston v. United States, 409 U.S. 352 (1973), is a seminal United States Supreme Court decision strictly construing the federal perjury statute.

Instead, the criminal-justice system had to rely on more carefully worded follow-up questions.
The decision has been cited in many cases since then and has become the controlling legal standard of perjury in federal jurisprudence. It was invoked during Bill Clinton's  impeachment proceedings in 1998 as a defense to charges of perjury against him.
It has long been criticized for the loophole it creates in the perjury statutes as essentially allowing a witness to lie without consequences. Nevertheless, later Courts have refused to overrule or otherwise limit it despite some moves in that direction by lower courts.",wiki
"Shapiro v. Thompson, 394 U.S. 618 (1969), was a landmark decision of the Supreme Court of the United States that invalidated state durational residency requirements for public assistance and helped establish a fundamental ""right to travel"" in U.S. law. Shapiro was a part of a set of three welfare cases all heard during the 1968–69 term by the Supreme Court, alongside Harrell v. Tobriner and Smith v. Reynolds. Additionally, Shapiro, King v. Smith (1968), and Goldberg v. Kelly (1970) comprise the ""Welfare Cases"", a set of successful Supreme Court cases that dealt with welfare.
Shapiro was not about the issue of welfare per se, but rather about the restrictions to the right to travel and possible violations of the Equal Protection Clause of the 14th Amendment. The question posed by Shapiro was whether Congress, in writing Section 602(b) of the Social Security Act, overstepped its regulating powers by giving states the ability to restrict travel. Although the Constitution does not explicitly mention the right to travel, it is implied by the other rights given in the Constitution. In 1969, 43 states had a residency requirement in effect, declared unconstitutional by Shapiro. Within those 43 states, it is estimated by the court that at least 100,000 people - minimum - were unable to get welfare aid. By 1970, there was a 17% increase in those nationally receiving AFDC aid due to Shapiro.: 87–89 ",wiki

The question in Walker is whether in a diversity action the federal court should follow state law or, alternatively, Rule 3 of the Federal Rules of Civil Procedure in determining when an action is commenced for the purpose of tolling the state statute of limitations (SOL).

The high court reiterated its earlier holdings that mathematical formulas in the abstract could not be patented, but it held that the mere presence of a software element did not make an otherwise patent-eligible machine or process patent ineligible. Diehr was the third member of a trilogy of Supreme Court decisions on the patent-eligibility of computer software related inventions.

"City of Richmond v. J.A. Croson Co., 488 U.S. 469 (1989), was a case in which the United States Supreme Court held that the minority set-aside program of  Richmond, Virginia, which gave preference to minority business enterprises (MBE) in the awarding of municipal contracts, was unconstitutional under the Equal Protection Clause. The Court found that the city failed to identify both the need for remedial action and that other non-discriminatory remedies would be insufficient.
Croson involved a minority set-aside program in the awarding of municipal contracts. Richmond, with a black population of just over 50 percent, had set a 30 percent goal in the awarding of city construction contracts, based on its findings that local, state, and national patterns of discrimination had resulted in all but complete lack of access for minority-owned businesses. The evidence that was introduced included: a statistical study indicating that, although the city's population was 50% black, only 0.67% of its prime construction contracts had been awarded to minority businesses in recent years; figures establishing that a variety of local contractors' associations had virtually no MBE members; the city's counsel's conclusion that the Plan was constitutional under Fullilove v. Klutznick, 448 U.S. 448; and the statements of Plan proponents indicating that there had been widespread racial discrimination in the local, state, and national construction industries. Pursuant to the Plan, the city adopted rules requiring individualized consideration of each bid or request for a waiver of the 30% set-aside, and providing that a waiver could be granted only upon proof that sufficient qualified MBE's were unavailable or unwilling to participate The Supreme Court stated:

We, therefore, hold that the city has failed to demonstrate a compelling interest in apportioning public contracting opportunities on the basis of race. To accept Richmond's claim that past societal discrimination alone can serve as the basis for rigid racial preferences would be to open the door to competing claims for ""remedial relief"" for every disadvantaged group. The dream of a Nation of equal citizens in a society where race is irrelevant to personal opportunity and achievement would be lost in a mosaic of shifting preferences based on inherently unmeasurable claims of past wrongs. [Citing Regents of the University of California v. Bakke]. Courts would be asked to evaluate the extent of the prejudice and consequent harm suffered by various minority groups. Those whose societal injury is thought to exceed some arbitrary level of tolerability then would be entitled to preferential classification. We think such a result would be contrary to both the letter and the spirit of a constitutional provision whose central command is equality.",wiki

"O'Connor v. Ortega, 480 U.S. 709 (1987), is a United States Supreme Court decision on the Fourth Amendment rights of government employees with regard to administrative searches in the workplace, during investigations by supervisors for violations of employee policy rather than by law enforcement for criminal offenses. It was brought by Magno Ortega, a doctor at a California state hospital after his supervisors found allegedly inculpatory evidence in his office while he was on administrative leave pending an investigation of alleged misconduct. Some of what they uncovered was later used to impeach a witness who testified on his behalf at the hearing where he unsuccessfully appealed his dismissal.
Although lower courts had considered the issue, it was the first time the Supreme Court had. By a 5-4 margin, the Court ruled that public employees retain their Fourth Amendment rights. Justice Sandra Day O'Connor's plurality opinion established an ""operating realities"" test for future courts to consider when public employees challenged searches during investigations, reflecting the lower reasonable suspicion standard the government had to meet as an employer. That did not establish binding precedent, since Antonin Scalia argued in a separate concurring opinion that her standard was too vague, and that the same searches which would be reasonable for a private employer were proper when conducted by their public counterparts. Harry Blackmun wrote for four dissenting justices that the search was clearly an investigatory one and thus a breach of the doctor's privacy.
Since it could not decide how to apply that standard to Ortega's case as the record at that time did not establish whether the entry into Ortega's office had been for search purposes or not, the majority remanded the case to the district court. Eleven more years of litigation followed. At some points during it Ortega had to represent himself, and the Court itself had taken the unusual step of inviting Joel Klein to argue Ortega's case before them. It went back and forth between the district and appellate courts twice. Ortega finally prevailed after a jury trial in the late 1990s, and the Ninth Circuit denied Ortega's superiors their appeal.
Despite the two different standards resulting from the split five-justice majority, lower courts have generally followed O'Connor's ""operational realities"" test in future cases involving actual searches. Observers thought the justices might resolve the conflict the next time a similar case of public employees alleging a search violated their Fourth Amendment rights came before it. When it did, in 2010's Ontario v. Quon, they declined to do so, leaving the matter open for yet another future Court.

"Bethel School District v. Fraser, 478 U.S. 675 (1986), was a landmark decision of the Supreme Court of the United States in which the Court upheld the suspension of a high school student who delivered a sexually suggestive speech at a school assembly. The case involved free speech in public schools.
On April 26, 1983, student Matthew Fraser was suspended from Bethel High School in Pierce County, Washington after he gave a speech including sexual innuendo while nominating a classmate for a student council position at a school assembly. Believing his speech to be inappropriate and vulgar, the school's administration suspended Fraser for three days and barred him from speaking at graduation. After unsuccessfully appealing his punishment through the school's grievance procedures, Fraser filed a lawsuit against the school board, claiming the suspension violated his right to free speech under the First Amendment to the U.S. Constitution.
The United States District Court and Ninth Circuit Court of Appeals both sided with Fraser. On appeal to the U.S. Supreme Court, a 7–2 majority held that his suspension did not violate the First Amendment.

Rohm & Haas Co., 448 U.S. 176 (1980), is a 1980 5–4 decision of the United States Supreme Court limiting the patent misuse doctrine and explaining the scope of the 1952 amendment of the patent laws that resurrected the contributory infringement doctrine in the wake of the Mercoid cases. The Mercoid  cases and a few predecessor cases had denied relief against patent infringement to patentees who were deriving revenue from the sale of unpatented products used as supplies for patented combinations or as components of patented combinations, even when the unpatented products were specially adapted for use with the patented combinations and even when they lacked any utility other than that use. The patentees used contributory infringement suits or threats of such suits to enforce their business model, which the Mercoid cases outlawed.
In the Mercoid cases the Court had stated: ""The result of this decision, together with those which have preceded it, is to limit substantially the doctrine of contributory infringement. What residuum may be left we need not stop to consider."" This caused ""some consternation among patent lawyers,"" and some  ""segments of the patent bar eventually decided to ask Congress for corrective legislation that would restore some scope to the contributory infringement doctrine. With great perseverance, they advanced their proposal in three successive Congresses before it eventually was enacted in 1952.""

"Mayo Foundation v. United States, 562 U.S. 44 (2011), is a United States Supreme Court case in which the Court upheld a Treasury Department regulation on the grounds that the courts should defer to government agencies in tax cases in absence of an unreasonable decision on the part of the agency.
Under the Federal Insurance Contributions Act (FICA), students and their educational employers are exempted from paying Social Security taxes. The Treasury Department issued a regulation in 2004, declaring those who worked more than 40 hours a week were ineligible for such an exemption. The Mayo Foundation filed suit to challenge the regulation and for a refund of the taxes it had paid on its medical residents—recently graduated physicians, who work more than full-time providing patient care but who are still considered trainees by the medical profession. The District Court ruled for the Mayo Foundation and struck the regulation, but was reversed by the Court of Appeals.
The Supreme Court ruled unanimously to uphold the regulation as within the Treasury Department's statutory authority to issue and as a reasonable construction of FICA. The Court clarified that the deferential standard of Chevron U.S.A., Inc. v. Natural Resources Defense Council, Inc. (1984) applied, notwithstanding prior Court rulings that had adopted a more stringent standard to tax regulations. Applying Chevron, the Court first found that Congress had left the matter to the agency, because the statute was silent on the definition of ""student"" and on its applicability to medical residents specifically. Second, the Court found, that the regulation was a reasonable interpretation of the statute, and that its clear line helped distinguish workers who study and students who work, simplified enforcement and furthered the broad coverage of Social Security.",wiki

In California, a judge may choose one of three sentences for a crime—a low, middle, or high term. There must exist specific aggravating factors about the crime before a judge may impose the high term. Under the Apprendi rule, as explained in Blakely v. Washington, any fact that increases the punishment above that which the judge may impose without that fact must be found by a jury beyond a reasonable doubt. In People v. Black, the California Supreme Court rejected the argument that under Blakely, the jury must find the additional facts necessary for the judge to impose the high term under the DSL. In Cunningham, the U.S. Supreme Court overruled Black, ruling that Blakely applies to California's determinate sentencing scheme.

"Stoner v. California, 376 U.S. 483 (1964), is a United States Supreme Court decision involving the Fourth Amendment. It was a criminal case appealed from the California Courts of Appeal after the California Supreme Court denied review. The case extended the situations under which search warrants are required as they reversed a robbery conviction made on the basis of evidence obtained in violation of the holding.
The petitioner, Joey Stoner, had been arrested following a 1960 supermarket robbery in the Los Angeles area. Eyewitness accounts and evidence left at the scene led the police to a hotel elsewhere in the region where Stoner was staying. Two days later, detectives went to the hotel and, with the desk clerk's permission, searched the room and found further evidence linking him to the robbery. Stoner was arrested two days later in Nevada, and extradited. The evidence from the hotel room was used to convict him of the robbery at trial. Stoner unsuccessfully challenged the admissibility of the evidence at trial and on appeal, since police had lacked a warrant and relied on the clerk's permission. The appeals court held that the search was incident to arrest and thus permissible.
Writing for the Court, Justice Potter Stewart reaffirmed two previous holdings: The first, Agnello v. United States (1925) held such warrantless searches are constitutional only to the extent that they take place at the same time, and in the same place, as the arrest. Two other cases established that the hotel clerk's consent did not permit police to search the room without a warrant. ""[A] guest in a hotel room is entitled to constitutional protection against unreasonable searches and seizures"" Stewart wrote. ""That protection would disappear if it were left to depend upon the unfettered discretion of an employee of the hotel."" It did not matter that hotel staff might be permitted to enter the room as that was merely for the limited purpose of cleaning and maintenance. The only other opinion was Justice John Marshall Harlan II, who concurred in the holding but dissented from the disposition reversing the conviction. He would have left it to California's courts to decide whether the admission of the hotel-room evidence was harmless error, as the Court had done in similar circumstances in Fahy v. Connecticut.
The reaffirmation of the earlier rulings was necessitated by the Mapp v. Ohio decision a few years earlier, which extended the exclusionary rule under which unlawfully obtained evidence is inadmissible at trial, to the states as well as the federal government. It came at a time when the Warren Court was beginning to rethink and provide exceptions to the traditional Fourth Amendment doctrine that only those with a possessory or proprietary interest in what was searched had standing to challenge the constitutionality of the search. Several years later, in Katz v. United States, the Court abandoned that doctrine entirely in favor of the reasonable expectation of privacy test now in use.",wiki

The Hill family had sued after Life implied in a blurb that the upcoming film adaptation of The Desperate Hours was based on the real-life incident where they were held hostage in their home by escaped convicts. It was accompanied by a photo of the Hills' house in a suburb of Philadelphia, from which they had moved shortly afterwards due to the lingering psychological effects of the episode.

The body that levies the tax must conduct an objective inquiry that looks to ""the mainsprings of human conduct to the totality of the fact of each case."" On review, the trier of fact must consider all of the evidence in front of it and determine whether the transferor's intention was either disinterested or involved:
Gifts result from ""detached and disinterested generosity"" and are often given out of ""affection, respect, admiration, charity or like impulses"".

"The Alien and Sedition Acts were a set of four laws enacted in 1798 that applied restrictions to immigration and speech in the United States. The Naturalization Act increased the requirements to seek citizenship, the Alien Friends Act allowed the president to imprison and deport non-citizens, the Alien Enemies Act gave the president additional powers to detain non-citizens during times of war, and the Sedition Act criminalized false and malicious statements about the federal government. The Alien Friends Act and the Sedition Act expired after a set number of years, and the Naturalization Act was repealed in 1802. The Alien Enemies Act is still in effect.
The Alien and Sedition Acts were controversial. They were supported by the Federalist Party, and supporters argued that the bills strengthened national security during the Quasi-War, an undeclared naval war with France from 1798 to 1800. The acts were denounced by Democratic-Republicans as suppression of voters and violation of free speech under the First Amendment. While they were in effect, the Alien and Sedition Acts, and the Sedition Act in particular, were used to suppress publishers affiliated with the Democratic-Republicans, and several publishers were arrested for criticism of the Adams administration. The Democratic-Republicans took power in 1800, because of backlash to the Alien and Sedition Acts, and all but the Alien Enemies Act were eliminated by the next Congress. The Alien Enemies Act has been invoked several times since, particularly during World War II. The Alien and Sedition Acts are generally received negatively by modern historians, and the U.S. Supreme Court has since indicated that aspects of the laws would likely be found unconstitutional today.

Cheek, a tax protester, for willful failure to file tax returns and tax evasion, who was convicted again during retrial. The Court held that an actual good-faith belief that one is not violating the tax law, based on a misunderstanding caused by the complexity of the tax law, negates willfulness, even if that belief is irrational or unreasonable. The Court also ruled that an actual belief that the tax law is invalid or unconstitutional is not a good faith belief based on a misunderstanding caused by the complexity of the tax law, and is not a defense.

"Mitsubishi Motors Corp. v. Soler Chrysler-Plymouth, Inc., 473 U.S. 614 (1985), is a United States Supreme Court decision concerning arbitration of antitrust claims. The Court heard the case on appeal from the United States Court of Appeals for the First Circuit, which had ruled that the arbitration clause in a Puerto Rican car dealer's franchise agreement was broad enough to reach its antitrust claim. By a 5–3 margin it upheld the lower court, requiring that the dealer arbitrate its claim before a panel in Tokyo, as stipulated in the contract.
Justice Harry Blackmun wrote for the majority that the Federal Arbitration Act (FAA) was broad enough to require arbitration of statutory claims as well as contractual ones, extending a recent line of Court decisions favorable to arbitration. A controversial footnote, creating a possible ""prospective waiver"" doctrine that would allow a party to avoid arbitration under foreign law, has been much criticized by commentators and at the same time raised by many litigants. In 2009 the Eleventh Circuit found it valid for an injured cruise-ship worker, but two years later cast doubt on that conclusion.
In dissent, Justice John Paul Stevens argued that antitrust claims were too complex and important to be left to arbitrators and that in any event none of the claims were arbitrable under the terms of the contract itself. He expressed incredulousness that his colleagues would require an American company to arbitrate a claim under American antitrust law before a panel of foreign arbitrators.
While the case formed an important part of the Court's expansion of arbitrability in the late 20th and early 21st centuries, it could not have reached a court today. In 2002, after years of lobbying by the National Automobile Dealers Association, Congress passed the Motor Vehicle Franchise Contract Arbitration Fairness Act, which prohibited mandatory predispute arbitration clauses in motor vehicle dealership franchise agreements.

"Flood v. Kuhn, 407 U.S. 258 (1972), was a decision by the Supreme Court of the United States that preserved the reserve clause in Major League Baseball (MLB) players' contracts. By a 5–3 margin, the Court reaffirmed the antitrust exemption that had been granted to professional baseball in 1922 under Federal Baseball Club v. National League, and previously affirmed by Toolson v. New York Yankees, Inc. in 1953. While the majority believed that baseball's antitrust exemption was anomalous compared to other professional sports, it held that any changes to the exemption should be made through Congress and not the courts.
The National League had instituted the reserve clause in 1879 as a means of limiting salaries by keeping players under team control. Under that system, a baseball team reserved players under contract for a year after the contract expired, preventing them from being taken by other teams in bidding wars. MLB team owners argued that the clause was necessary to ensure a competitive balance among teams, as otherwise wealthier clubs would outbid teams in smaller markets for star players. The reserve clause was not addressed in Federal Baseball, where Ned Hanlon, owner of the rival Federal League's (FL) Baltimore Terrapins, had argued that MLB had violated the Sherman Antitrust Act through anticompetitive practices meant to force the FL out of business. The Supreme Court ruled that baseball did not qualify as interstate commerce for the purposes of the Sherman Act, a ruling that remained even after it denied boxing and American football the same exemption.
In 1969, Curt Flood, a center fielder for the St. Louis Cardinals, was traded to the Philadelphia Phillies. Flood was unhappy with the trade, as the Phillies were not known to treat players well, but the reserve clause required him to play for Philadelphia. He retained attorney Arthur Goldberg, a former Supreme Court justice, through Marvin Miller and the Major League Baseball Players Association (MLBPA) and took the case to court, arguing that the reserve clause was a collusive measure that reduced competition and thus an antitrust violation. The reserve system was upheld by all three courts under the principle of stare decisis and the precedents set by Federal Baseball and Toolson.
Legal scholars have criticized the Court's decision in Flood both for its rigid application of stare decisis as well as Section I of Harry Blackmun's majority opinion, an ""ode to baseball"" that contains little legal matter. The reserve clause was settled outside the Supreme Court three years later through the arbitration system created by the collective bargaining agreement between MLB and the MLBPA. Peter Seitz ruled in favor of Andy Messersmith and Dave McNally that their contracts could only be renewed without their permission for one season, after which they became free agents. Free agency in MLB was codified the following year after the 1976 Major League Baseball lockout, while the Curt Flood Act of 1998, signed by Bill Clinton, ended baseball's antitrust exemption as it related to interactions between players and owners, but preserved it in other areas such as franchise relocation. Courts have continued to differ over the extent of the exemption; a 2021 suit filed over that year's minor league reorganization asks that it be rescinded entirely.",wiki

"Haig v. Agee, 453 U.S. 280 (1981), was a United States Supreme Court case that upheld the right of the executive branch to revoke a citizen's passport for reasons of national security and the foreign policy interests of the U.S. under the Passport Act of 1926.
The case involved Congressional delegation of authority over control of passports and the right to international travel.  Philip Agee was an ex-Central Intelligence Agency (CIA) officer living overseas who in 1974 declared a ""campaign to fight the U.S. CIA wherever it is operating"" and revealed the identities of several CIA officers resulting in violence against them. The Secretary of State revoked Agee's passport in 1979. Agee sued, alleging the secretary had no such authority, had denied him procedural due process rights, his substantive due process ""liberty"" right to travel under the Fifth Amendment, and had violated his First Amendment right to criticize government policies.
The district court found the Secretary lacked the power to revoke the passport and the Court of Appeals for the District of Columbia affirmed that decision. The Supreme Court reversed the lower court, holding that  the broad discretion accorded the executive branch in matters of national security and foreign policy requires that the Passport Act of 1926 (currently codified at 22 U.S.C. § 211a et seq.) should be interpreted as granting the power to revoke a passport when necessary for national security.",wiki

The case is often cited as a basis for parents' right to educate their children outside of traditional private or public schools.
Like Sherbert v. Verner, the Court in Yoder required the government accommodate religious exercise by applying strict scrutiny to a neutral law that burdened religious exercise. Yoder differs from Sherbert v. Verner  because the compulsory school attendance law was non-discriminatory and did not include a mechanism for individualized exemptions.

"Hazelwood School District et al. v. Kuhlmeier et al., 484 U.S. 260 (1988), was a landmark decision by the Supreme Court of the United States which held, in a 5–3 decision, that student speech in a school-sponsored student newspaper at a public high school could be censored by school officials without a violation of First Amendment rights if the school's actions were ""reasonably related"" to a legitimate pedagogical concern.
The case concerned the censorship of two articles in The Spectrum, the student newspaper of Hazelwood East High School in St. Louis County, Missouri, 1983. When the school principal removed an article concerning divorce and another concerning teen pregnancy, the student journalists sued, claiming that their First Amendment rights had been violated. A lower court sided with the school, but its decision was overturned by the U.S. Court of Appeals for the Eighth Circuit, which sided with the students and found that the paper was a ""public forum"" comparable to speech outside an educational setting. The Supreme Court reversed, noting that the paper was established by school officials as a limited forum for the purpose of a supervised journalism class, and could be censored even though similar speech in an off-campus or independent student newspaper would be protected. 
The case, and the earlier Tinker v. Des Moines Independent Community School District (1969), are considered landmark decisions for defining the right of expression for students in public schools. While subsequent court rulings have varied on when Kuhlmeier applies, the case remains a strong precedent in the regulation of student speech. However, the state statutes protecting student free expression, enacted by 17 states as of March 23, 2023, most in response to the limitations of Kuhlmeier, typically adopt the more protective Tinker precedent.",wiki

The Court also determined that the Ohio law at issue was not overbroad, relying on a narrowing interpretation of the law the Ohio Supreme Court had adopted in prior proceedings in the case; however, because it was unclear whether the state had proved all the elements of the crime, the Court ordered a new trial.

"On the day following a California police officer's encounter with a known marijuana dealer, including the purchase from the dealer of a package of marijuana, other police officers observed an encounter between the dealer and the defendant husband, which occurred under identical surrounding circumstances except that the officers did not see any substance passing between the two men. The officers following the defendant lost contact with him when he made a U-turn in the middle of a block. Without securing a search warrant, the officers, among them one having information that the defendant husband was selling from his apartment marijuana possibly secured from the dealer, obtained from the building manager a passkey to defendants' apartment, and entered the apartment, where they found the defendant husband in the living room. The defendant wife emerged from the kitchen, and one of the officers, after identifying himself, observed through the open doorway of the kitchen a package of marijuana on a scale atop the kitchen sink. The officers then arrested both defendants and searched the apartment, finding additional marijuana in the kitchen cupboard and atop the bedroom dresser. The defendants were convicted in the Superior Court of Los Angeles County of possessing marijuana. Their convictions were affirmed by the California District Court of Appeal on the grounds that there was probable cause for the arrests, that the officers' entry into the apartment was for the purpose of arrest and was not unlawful, and that the search, being incident to the arrests, was likewise lawful and its fruits admissible in evidence against the defendants.

"A fast-food Mexican restaurant chain, alleging that a second chain which had opened restaurants with a very similar motif had thereby infringed the first chain's trade dress in violation of 43(a) of the Trademark Act of 1946 (Lanham Act) (15 USCS 1125(a)) (later amended)--which provided that any person who used, in connection with any goods or services, any false description or representation was liable to any person damaged by such use--brought an action against the second chain in the United States District Court for the Southern District of Texas. The District Court instructed the jury that trade dress--that is, the total image and appearance of a business--was protected under 43(a) if it either was inherently distinctive or had acquired a secondary meaning--that is, a unique association with a specific source.

The board denied both applications on the ground that the film appeared to be ""church related."" Claiming that the board's actions violated, among other things, the free speech clause of the Federal Constitution's First Amendment, the church and its pastor brought suit against the board in the United States District Court for the Eastern District of New York. The District Court, in granting summary judgment for the board, (1) characterized the board's school facilities as a ""limited public forum""; (2) noted that the board had not opened its facilities to organizations similar to the church for religious purposes; and (3) concluded that the denials in question were ""viewpoint neutral"" (736 F Supp 1247). The United States Court of Appeals for the Second Circuit affirmed (959 F2d 381).",lexis
"The defendant contended that, as a juvenile who did not commit or intend to commit homicide, the sentence of life imprisonment without parole constituted cruel and unusual punishment. The U.S. Supreme Court held that U.S. Const. amend. VIII prohibited the imposition of a life-without-parole sentence on the juvenile offender who committed a nonhomicide crime and, while the defendant need not be guaranteed eventual release from the life sentence, he must have some realistic opportunity to obtain release before the end of the life term. The practice of sentencing a juvenile who did not commit a homicide offense to life without parole was exceedingly rare and a national community consensus developed against it, and none of the recognized goals of penal sanctions, i.e., retribution, deterrence, incapacitation, and rehabilitation, provided an adequate justification for the sentence. Further, it could not be conclusively determined at the time of sentencing that the juvenile defendant would be a danger to society for the rest of his life, and a sentence of life without parole improperly denied the juvenile offender a chance to demonstrate growth, maturity, and rehabilitation.",lexis

"Prior to trial in the United States District Court for the District of Colorado on a narcotics indictment, a defendant moved to sever his case from that of two codefendants, advising the court that the government intended to call his wife, an unindicted co-conspirator, as an adverse witness, and asserting his claim to a privilege to prevent her from testifying against him. After a hearing at which the defendant's wife was called as a government witness under a grant of use immunity and testified, among other things, that her cooperation with the government was based on assurances that she would be given lenient treatment, the District Court denied the motion, ruling that the defendant's wife could testify in support of the government's case to any act she observed during the marriage and to any communication made in the presence of a third person, but that confidential communications between the defendant and his wife were to be privileged and inadmissible. After being tried and convicted, the defendant appealed to the United States Court of Appeals for the Tenth Circuit, claiming that the admission of the adverse testimony of his wife, over his objection was reversible error since it contravened the United States Supreme Court's teaching in Hawkins v United States (1958) 358 US 74, 3 L Ed 2d 125, 79 S Ct 136, that the testimony of one spouse against the other is barred unless both consent.

The District Court, acting as trier of fact in a full bench trial, (1) found that (a) the employee had established a prima facie case of racial discrimination, and (b) the reasons that the employer gave for the demotion and discharge were not the real reasons for the demotion and discharge, but (2) ruled for the employer on the basis that the employee had failed to carry his ultimate burden of proving that his race was the determining factor in the employer's allegedly discriminatory actions (756 F Supp 1244). The United States Court of Appeals for the Eighth Circuit reversed and remanded, expressing the view that, once the employee had proved all of the employer's proffered reasons for the adverse employment actions to be pretextual, the employee was entitled to judgment as a matter of law (970 F2d 487).",lexis
"The ordinance violated the Tonnage Clause. The Clause's prohibition embraced all taxes and duties regardless of their name or form, and even though not measured by tonnage, which operated to impose a charge for the privilege of entering, trading in, or lying in a port. The ordinance taxed no other form of personal property and its amount depended upon the ship's capacity. It raised revenue for general municipal services, which argued in favor of applying the Clause. The ordinance applied almost exclusively to oil tankers and was closely correlated with cargo capacity. Entry into port automatically established a tax situs in the City. Whatever words the City used to describe the tax imposed on mobile homes, trailers, and recreational vehicles, it in fact taxed those vehicles only when they were a form of real property like a home. The ship tax differed from the tax on other oil-related property under Alaska Stat. _ 43.56.210 (2008), in that it was a purely municipal tax with no effective electorate-related check upon the City's vessel-taxing power.",lexis

"Following his discharge from employment, the plaintiff, a black, filed a grievance under a collective-bargaining agreement which contained a nondiscrimination clause. Prior to an arbitration hearing on the plaintiff's claim under the collective-bargaining agreement, plaintiff filed a charge of racial discrimination with the Colorado Civil Rights Commission which referred the matter to the Equal Employment Opportunity Commission. Thereafter, the arbitrator, without referring to the plaintiff's claim of racial discrimination, found that the plaintiff had been discharged for cause. Following a determination by the Equal Employment Opportunity Commission that there was not reasonable cause to believe that Title VII of the Civil Rights Act of 1964 (42 USCS 2000e et seq.), which requires equal employment opportunities, had been violated, the plaintiff instituted the instant action under Title VII in the United States District Court for the District of Colorado. The District Court granted summary judgment against the plaintiff and dismissed the action on the ground that having voluntarily elected to pursue his grievance to final arbitration under the nondiscrimination clause of the collective bargaining agreement, the plaintiff was bound by the arbitral decision and thereby precluded from suing his employer under Title VII (346 F Supp 1012).

One of the counts alleged federal jurisdiction in the District Court and asserted a private claim for relief under 18 USCS 610--a criminal statute prohibiting corporations from making contributions or expenditures in connection with federal elections. Following the District Court's denial of a preliminary injunction and an affirmance of the ruling by the United States Court of Appeals for the Third Circuit, there were subsequent proceedings in the District Court at which the stockholder filed an amended complaint. Summary judgment for the defendant directors was granted, but the United States Court of Appeals for the Third Circuit reversed, holding that since the amended complaint sought damages on behalf of the corporation for violation of 610, the controversy was not moot, although the election which occasioned it was over, and that a private cause of action, whether brought by a citizen to secure injunctive relief or by a stockholder to secure injunctive or derivative damage relief, was proper to remedy the violation of 610 (496 F2d 416).",lexis

Such order (1) provided that the board must move toward a goal under which the ratio of white to Negro faculty members in each school was substantially the same as the ratio throughout the school system, (2) fixed the ratio as to the assignment of substitute, student, and night school teachers in each school almost immediately at substantially the same as the ratio of Negro to white teachers in each such group for the entire system, (3) directed that for the coming school year, schools with less than 12 full-time teachers have at least one teacher whose race was different from the race of the majority of the faculty at that school, and that schools with 12 or more full-time teachers have at least one teacher of a minority race for every 6 faculty and staff members, whereas the ratio of white to Negro full-time teachers in the entire system was 3 to 2, and (4) reserved for later decision the goals to be required for future years.

"Gartenberg was correct in its basic ¬¨√ü 80a-35(b) formulation: for liability, an adviser's fee had to be so disproportionately large that it bore no reasonable relationship to the services rendered and could not have been the product of arm's length bargaining. The test's essence was whether under all the circumstances the transaction carried the earmarks of an arm's length bargain, and the shareholders had the burden of proof. The measure of deference owed to a board varied depending on the circumstances. Courts could compare fees charged to different types of clients, but the Investment Company Act of 1940 did not necessarily ensure fee parity between mutual funds and institutional clients. Courts were also not to rely too heavily on comparisons with fees of other advisers. The standard for fiduciary breach under ¬¨√ü 80a-35(b) did not call for judicial second-guessing of informed board decisions.

"In connection with an investigation of alleged interstate transportation of obscene materials, a federal grand jury sitting in the Eastern District of Virginia issued subpoenas duces tecum to three corporations--the first of which distributed sexually oriented paperback books, magazines, and videotapes, the second of which distributed adult materials, and the third of which sold books, magazines, and videotapes. All three corporations were based in New York and were wholly owned by the same person. The subpoenas sought a variety of corporate books and records as well as copies of 193 videotapes that the videotape distributor had shipped to retailers in the Eastern District of Virginia. The United States District Court for the Eastern District of Virginia denied the motions of all three corporations to quash the subpoenas, and, after the corporations still refused to comply with the subpoenas, the District Court found each corporation in contempt.

In quashing the subpoenas, the Court of Appeals concluded that, because there was no evidence in the record that either of the two corporations had ever shipped materials into, or otherwise conducted business in, the Eastern District of Virginia, and because any evidence concerning matters outside Virginia would most likely be inadmissible on relevancy grounds at any trial that might occur, the subpoenas failed to meet the requirement--established in a prior Supreme Court case with respect to subpoenas issued in the trial context--that any documents subpoenaed under Rule 17(c) of the Federal Rules of Criminal Procedure, which governs the issuance of subpoenas duces tecum in federal criminal proceedings, must be admissible as evidence at trial.",lexis

"The trial of a capital offense in Illinois is conducted in two phases, with the same jury being used in each phase. If the defendant is convicted of first-degree murder in the first phase, a separate sentencing hearing is held as the second phase to determine the existence of aggravating and mitigating factors, and the defendant is sentenced to death if the jury unanimously determines that (1) at least one statutory aggravating factor exists, and (2) there are no mitigating factors sufficient to preclude the imposition of a death sentence. An Illinois trial court, conducting voir dire in a capital case, questioned each venire--at the request of the prosecution, and over defense objections--whether any member had moral or religious scruples that would prevent the member from imposing the death penalty regardless of the facts. The trial court refused a defense request to ask prospective jurors whether they would automatically vote to impose the death penalty if they found the defendant guilty, as the trial court found that it had asked substantially the same question in a different manner--the court having asked (1) 9 of the 12 jurors eventually impaneled whether they would follow his instructions on the law even if they disagreed, and (2) all of the jurors whether they felt that they could be fair and impartial. When impaneled, the jurors swore an oath to render a verdict according to the law and the evidence. The jury thereafter convicted the defendant of first-degree murder and sentenced him to death. In affirming the conviction and sentence on appeal, the Supreme Court of Illinois held that (1) there is no rule requiring a trial court to ""life qualify"" a jury to exclude all jurors who believe that the death penalty should be imposed in every murder case; and (2) the defendant's sentence was valid, given that none of the jurors actually selected either (a) expressed any views that would call his or her impartiality into question, or (b) was shown to be biased in favor of the death penalty (142 Ill 2d 410, 154 Ill Dec 534, 568 NE2d 755).",lexis

As to the other claims for delay damages and time extensions, the Court of Claims held that since the Board of Contract Appeals lacked authority under the disputes clause to consider delay damages, the administrative findings pertaining to the claims were subject to de novo determination in the court, notwithstanding that the board did have authority to consider the requests for time extensions.

Although he was not a member of the Communist Party, he considered himself a revolutionary Marxist, and he advocated the economic, governmental, and international doctrines of world Communism.

Within Wisconsin, the manufacturer did not (1) own or lease real property, (2) operate any manufacturing, training, or warehouse facility, or (3) have a telephone listing or bank account. However, the manufacturer did conduct business activities within Wisconsin which included (1) the replacement of retailers' stale gum by sales representatives, from stock in the sales representatives' possession, at no cost to retailers; (2) the supplying of gum through ""agency stock checks,"" for which retailers were to be billed later by a wholesaler for the quantity supplied; (3) the storage of gum, display racks, and promotional literature; (4) the rental of space for storage of such materials; (5) the regional manager's recruitment, training, and evaluation of employees, which activities were conducted either in the basement of the manager's home or at a hotel or motel; and (6) the regional manager's intervention in credit disputes, which involved contacting the Chicago office in situations involving important accounts. In 1980, the Wisconsin Department of Revenue issued a franchise tax assessment against the manufacturer, based upon a percentage of the manufacturer's apportionable income during 6 preceding years. The manufacturer objected to the assessment and contended that, since its ctivities in Wisconsin were limited to the ""solicitation of orders"" within the meaning of 15 USCS 381(a)--which generally prohibited a state from taxing income derived within the state from interstate commerce where the only business activities within the state consisted of ""solicitation of orders"" for tangible goods--the manufacturer was immune from Wisconsin franchise taxes. The Wisconsin Tax Appeals Commission upheld the imposition of the tax against the manufacturer. The Wisconsin Circuit Court for Dane County, Wisconsin, reversed on the merits (CCH Wis Tax Rptr 203-000); the Wisconsin Court of Appeals reversed the Circuit Court's decision (153 Wis 2d 559, 451 NW2d 444); and the Supreme Court of Wisconsin in turn reversed the Court of Appeals' decision, which result disallowed the imposition of the tax (160 Wis 2d 53, 465 NW2d 800).",lexis
"The United States Customs Service, which has as its primary enforcement mission the interdiction and seizure of illegal drugs smuggled into the country, has implemented a drug-screening program requiring urinalysis tests of Service employees seeking transfer or promotion to positions having a direct involvement in drug interdiction or requiring the incumbent to carry firearms or to handle ""classified"" material. Among other things, the program requires that an applicant be notified that his selection is contingent upon successful completion of drug screening, sets forth procedures for collection and analysis of the requisite samples and procedures designed both to ensure against adulteration or substitution of specimens and to limit the intrusion on employee privacy, and provides that test results may not be turned over to any other agency, including criminal prosecutors, without the employee's written consent. Petitioners, a federal employees' union and one of its officials, filed suit on behalf of Service employees seeking covered positions, alleging that the drug-testing program violated, inter alia, the Fourth Amendment. The District Court agreed and enjoined the program. The Court of Appeals vacated the injunction, holding that, although the program effects a search within the meaning of the Fourth Amendment, such searches are reasonable in light of their limited scope and the Service's strong interest in detecting drug use among employees in covered positions.",lexis
"The petitioner, a union member, filed a complaint with the Secretary of Labor requesting that the election of the union's officers be set aside because of violations of the Labor-Management Reporting and Disclosure Act. In the United States District Court for the District of Columbia, the Secretary instituted an action against the union seeking to have the election set aside on the grounds of certain violations of the Act. The petitioner sought to intervene in the action, pursuant to Rule 24(a)(2) of the Federal Rules of Civil Procedure, in order (1) to urge that the election be set aside on two grounds in addition to those alleged by the Secretary, (2) to seek certain specific safeguards with respect to any new election which might be ordered, and (3) to present evidence and argument in support of the Secretary's challenge to the election. The petitioner's motion to intervene was denied by the District Court on the ground that 403 of the Act, by making the Secretary's suit the ""exclusive"" postelection remedy for a violation of the Act, precluded union members from challenging elections by way of intervention (51 FRD 270). The Court of Appeals for the District of Columbia Circuit affirmed.",lexis
"A provision of the Protection of Children Against Sexual Exploitation Act of 1977 (18 USCS 2252) provides for criminal penalties against any person who (1) knowingly transports or ships in interstate or foreign commerce visual depictions of minors engaged in sexually explicit conduct; or (2) knowingly receives, distributes, or reproduces such depictions. The term ""minor"" is defined in the statute as any person under the age of 18 (18 USCS 2256(1)). The owner and operator of a video company sold and shipped to an undercover police officer pornographic videotapes which featured a performer who had made the tapes when she was under the age of 18. After a trial in the United States District Court for the Central District of California, the company and its owner were convicted of violating 2252. On appeal to the United States Court of Appeals for the Ninth Circuit, the owner argued, among other things, that 2252 was facially unconstitutional as lacking a scienter requirement, that is, a requirement that defendants knew that they were distributing or shipping child pornography. The Court of Appeals remanded the case to the District Court in light of a previous Court of Appeals decision which had held that 2252 did not contain a scienter requirement. On remand, the District Court upheld the constitutionality of 2252 and refused to set aside the judgment of conviction. On appeal for the second time, the Court of Appeals (1) held that (a) 2252 lacked a requirement that the defendant possess knowledge of the fact that one performer had not reached the age of majority at the time that the visual depiction was produced, (b) the Federal Constitution's First Amendment mandated that a child pornography statute require knowledge of the minority of at least one performer as an element of the crime, and (c) 2252 was thus unconstitutional on its face; and accordingly (2) reversed the judgment of conviction (982 F2d 1285).",lexis

The District Court held the patents invalid for want of invention, but enjoined the retailer from unfairly competing by selling pole lamps identical to or confusingly similar to the patentee's lamps. The United States Court of Appeals for the Seventh Circuit affirmed on the ground that the likelihood of confusion as to the source of the products was sufficient to make out a case of unfair competition under Illinois law, without a showing that the retailer had palmed off its lamps as the patentee's lamps.

"The owners contended that punitive damages were not available against the owners based solely upon the recklessness of its managerial employee, that the express pollution penalties of the Clean Water Act (CWA), 33 U.S.C.S. _ 1251 et seq., precluded an additional penalty of punitive damages, and that the punitive award of approximately five times the amount of the compensatory award was excessive. While equally divided concerning whether the owners could be held vicariously liable for punitive damages, the U.S. Supreme Court held that the CWA did not preclude the award but a reduction of the amount of the award was warranted. The penalties for pollution under the CWA did not displace compensatory and punitive remedies for the consequences of such pollution, including the economic harm suffered by the individuals. However, punitive damages in the maritime tort case were not warranted in an amount greater than the amount of the compensatory damages award, and thus the punitive damages were excessive.",lexis
"Defendant, the president of a national food chain corporation, was charged, along with the corporation which entered a guilty plea, with violating 301(k) of the Federal Food, Drug, and Cosmetic Act (21 USCS 331(k)) on the ground that food in the corporation's Baltimore warehouse had been exposed to rodent contamination. At the trial of the corporation's president in the United States District Court for the District of Maryland, evidence was introduced demonstrating that in April of 1970, prior to the alleged violations at issue in the instant case, the Food and Drug Administration had advised the president by letter of insanitary conditions in the corporation's Philadelphia warehouse. Defense motions for acquittal, based on the ground that the evidence showed that the president was not personally concerned with the violations, were denied following the close of the government's case-in-chief and following the close of all evidence. After the District Court overruled the defense's objection that the jury instructions failed to properly define ""responsible relationship,"" the jury found the president guilty. On appeal, the United States Court of Appeals for the Fourth Circuit reversed and held that (1) the jury instructions might well have left the jury with the erroneous impression that the corporation's president could be found guilty in the absence of wrongful action on his part, and (2) the admission in evidence of the earlier Food and Drug Administration warning to the president concerning the Philadelphia warehouse was error warranting reversal (499 F2d 839).",lexis

"The Sentencing Reform Act of 1984 (SRA) (18 USCS 3551 et seq., 28 USCS 991-998) abolished the system of indeterminate sentencing and parole formerly applied in federal criminal cases, which system had given federal judges discretion within broad limits in setting the type and extent of punishment imposed on offenders, and the SRA created the United States Sentencing Commission, which was given the authority to promulgate binding sentencing guidelines that established ranges of determinate sentences for all categories of federal offenses and defendants according to various specified factors. The Commission, established as an independent commission within the judicial branch of the Federal Government, was to consist of seven members appointed by the President and subject to removal by him for neglect of duty, malfeasance, or other good cause; at least 3 of the members had to be federal judges, selected by the President from a list of 6 judges recommended by the Judicial Conference of the United States. A defendant indicted in the United States District Court for the Western District of Missouri on charges relating to a cocaine sale moved to have the guidelines promulgated by the Commission ruled invalid under the Federal Constitution, on the grounds that (1) the Commission was constituted in violation of the established doctrine of separation of powers, and (2) Congress had delegated excessive authority to the Commission to structure the guidelines. The District Court upheld the validity of the sentencing guidelines (682 F Supp 1033). The defendant then pleaded guilty to one count of the indictment, the remaining counts were dismissed on the prosecution's motion, and the defendant was sentenced in accordance with the guidelines. The defendant filed a notice of appeal to the United States Court of Appeals for the Eighth Circuit, but both the defendant and the prosecution subsequently petitioned the United States Supreme Court for certiorari before judgment.",lexis

The District Court denied relief, and the District Court's judgment was affirmed by the Court of Appeals for the Ninth Circuit, which ruled that the charged Sherman Act violation was fully answered by defendants' proof that numerous appliance retailers, some located near plaintiff, sold many competing brands of appliances, including those defendants allegedly refused to sell to plaintiff (255 F2d 214).",lexis
"A provision of the Ethics Reform Act of 1989 (5 USCS Appx 501(b)) made it unlawful for federal employees to receive any ""honorarium,"" a term defined in 5 USCS Appx 505(3) as generally meaning a payment for an appearance, speech, or article. The ban on honoraria was enacted in response to a federal commission's report which had found that some senior federal officials were supplementing their official compensation by accepting honoraria. To offset the honoraria ban, a statutory salary increase of 25 percent was granted to members of Congress, federal judges, and executive branch employees above a stated salary grade. Also, regulations issued by the Office of Government Ethics with respect to executive branch employees ( 5 CFR 2636.201 et seq.) excluded from the coverage of 501(b) a variety of performances and writings. Nevertheless, several executive branch employees and two labor unions filed suit in the United States District Court for the District of Columbia to challenge the validity of the honoraria ban under the Federal Constitution's First Amendment. Each of the individual employees alleged having received compensation in the past for writing or speaking on various topics--generally having nothing to do with the employees' jobs--in compliance with earlier regulations. One of the unions was certified by the District Court as the representative of a class composed of all executive branch employees below the stated salary grade who, but for 501(b), would have received honoraria. One individual plaintiff, who was not below the stated grade, was not a member of the class. The District Court, granting the employees' motion for summary judgment, (1) expressed the view that 501(b) was unconstitutional insofar as it applied to executive branch employees; and (2) enjoined the government from enforcing the statute against any executive branch employee (788 F Supp 4). The United States Court of Appeals for the District of Columbia Circuit, in affirming, expressed the view that the proper remedy for the unconstitutionality of 501(b) was to sever 501(b)'s application to executive branch employees (990 F2d 1271).

"A ski resort operator filed suit in the United States District Court for the District of Colorado against the operator of three other skiing facilities in the area, alleging that the latter had monopolized the local market for downhill ski services, in violation of 2 of the Sherman Act (15 USCS 2), by refusing to continue a long-standing marketing arrangement whereby skiers could purchase 6-day tickets usable on a given day at any of the four facilities and the competitors would divide up the revenues based on statistics as to actual usage, and by taking additional actions which made it difficult for the smaller operator to market a multi-area package of its own. The District Court entered judgment on a jury verdict in favor of the smaller operator, after instructing the jury that a firm possessing monopoly power violates 2 of the Sherman Act if it willfully acquires, maintains, or uses that power by anticompetitive or exclusionary means or for anticompetitive or exclusionary purposes, but does not violate the law by refusing to deal with a competitor if there are valid business reasons for that refusal. The United States Court of Appeals for the Tenth Circuit affirmed, holding that the multi-day, multi-area tickets in question could be characterized as an ""essential facility"" which the larger operator had a duty to market jointly with its competitor, and that there was sufficient evidence to support a finding that the larger operator's intent in refusing to continue the marketing arrangement was to create or maintain a monopoly (738 F2d 1509).",lexis
"An accused was convicted in a Wisconsin court on noncapital charges of murder and attempted murder. The accused unsuccessfully claimed on direct review that his federal constitutional right to confrontation had been violated at his trial. In 1992, the accused filed a habeas corpus application in a Federal District Court and again asserted his confrontation claim. However, in 1995, the District Court denied him relief. While an appeal by the accused to the United States Court of Appeals for the Seventh Circuit was pending, Congress enacted the Antiterrorism and Effective Death Penalty Act of 1996, which, among other provisions, (1) made several changes to Chapter 153 of Title 28 of the United States Code (28 USCS 2241 et seq.)--which generally governed federal habeas corpus review--including the enactment of a new version of 28 USCS 2254(d) to govern the standards affecting the entitlement of state prisoners to federal habeas corpus relief; (2) created a new Chapter 154 of Title 28 (28 USCS 2261 et seq.), with special federal habeas corpus rules favorable to a state party in capital cases if the state met certain conditions; and (3) in 107(c) of the 1996 Act (note following 28 USCS 2261), provided that Chapter 154 would apply to cases pending on or after the 1996 Act's date of enactment. The Court of Appeals ordered a rehearing en banc and eventually (96 F3d 856) upheld the denial of habeas corpus relief to the accused, as the Court of Appeals (1) expressed the view that the 1996 Act's changes to Chapter 153 applied to cases that were pending on the date of the 1996 Act's enactment; and (2) on the authority of the statute as amended, rejected the accused's confrontation claim on the merits.",lexis
"After federal agents had arrested the defendant in Missouri for selling stolen weapons, given him his Miranda warnings, and obtained a written waiver of his rights to remain silent and to obtain counsel, they proceeded to question him about a Colorado murder as well as the weapons charges, although they had not previously informed him that they would do so. During the interview, the defendant said that he had ""shot another guy once,"" but he denied ever having been to Colorado and denied having shot the alleged murder victim. However, in a subsequent interview with Colorado police, after he had again been advised of and waived his Miranda rights, the defendant admitted aiding the actual killer. At the defendant's trial for murder, the District Court of Moffat County, Colorado, (1) held that the defendant's statement in the first interview that he had ""shot another guy once"" was inadmissible on grounds of irrelevancy, but (2) ruled that the validity of the defendant's waiver in the first interview was not affected by the agents' failure to inform him that he would be questioned about the murder, and therefore (3) denied the defendant's motion to suppress the confession he had made in the second interview. The defendant was convicted of first-degree murder. The Colorado Court of Appeals, however, reversed the defendant's conviction and remanded for a new trial, on the grounds (1) that the waiver in the first interview was invalid as to the murder, because a suspect cannot intelligently decide whether he wants counsel if knowledge of the crime is withheld; and (2) that the prosecution bore the burden of proving that the defendant's confession during the second interview was not a product of his incriminating statements in the first interview (671 P2d 965). The Supreme Court of Colorado affirmed and remanded, holding that the extent to which suspects have been informed in advance regarding the subject of an interrogation is one factor in determining the validity of their waivers of their Miranda rights (713 P2d 865).",lexis

At a hearing on the motion to suppress, the police officer testified that prior to stopping the vehicle he had observed neither traffic or equipment violations, nor any suspicious activity, and that he had made the stop only in order to check the driver's license and the registration of the vehicle. Finding the police officer's stop and detention to have been violative of the Fourth Amendment, the trial court granted the motion to suppress. The Delaware Supreme Court affirmed, holding that a random stop of a motorist in the absence of specific articulable facts justifying the stop by indicating a reasonable suspicion that a violation of law has occurred was constitutionally impermissible and violative of the Fourth and Fourteenth Amendments (382 A2d 1359).",lexis

The United States District Court for the Southern District of New York held that the second magazine's use of the memoirs constituted an infringement under the Copyright Act (17 USCS 106). The United States Court of Appeals for the Second Circuit reversed, holding that copyright protection applied only to the use of the author's particular expression rather than of the facts recorded, and that the second magazine's limited use of direct quotations from the manuscript was a ""fair use"" which was protected under the Copyright Act (17 USCS 107), especially in view of the news reporting purpose of the article and the politically significant nature of the material (723 F2d 195).",lexis

Although registration for the draft was discontinued in 1975, President Carter determined in early 1980 that it was necessary to reactivate the registration process, and recommended that funds be transferred from the Department of Defense to the Selective Service System for this purpose. He also recommended that Congress amend the Act to permit the registration and conscription of women as well as men. Congress agreed that is was necessary to reactivate the registration process; however, it allocated only those funds necessary to register males and, although it considered the question at great length, it declined to amend the Act to permit the registration of women. Thereafter, the President ordered the registration of specified groups of young men pursuant to 3 of the Act. Ultimately ruling in a case which had been brought nearly ten years earlier in the United States District Court for the Eastern District of Pennsylvania by several men subject to registration for the draft and subsequent induction into the armed services, a three-judge Federal District Court held that the Act's gender-based discrimination violated the due process clause of the Fifth Amendment and permanently enjoined registration under the Act (509 F Supp 586).",lexis

The accused refused to answer any questions but did not request the assistance of an attorney. After a public defender represented the accused at a bail hearing on the armed robbery charge, the accused, while in jail awaiting further proceedings on that charge, was questioned by a sheriff's department detective about three other crimes--a murder, an attempted murder, and an armed burglary--which the accused was suspected of committing. The accused was advised of his Miranda rights, signed forms waiving the rights, and admitted his involvement in the three crimes. He was subsequently convicted of the three crimes after his pretrial motion to suppress his incriminating statements made in jail was denied. On appeal, the accused contended that his courtroom appearance with an attorney at the bail hearing constituted an invocation of the right, derived by Miranda from the Fifth Amendment privilege against self-incrimination, to the assistance of counsel during custodial interrogation, but the Wisconsin Supreme Court, affirming the conviction, held, in response to a question certified to the court, that an accused's request for counsel at an initial appearance on a charged offense does not constitute an invocation of the accused's Fifth Amendment right to counsel that precludes police interrogation on unrelated, uncharged offenses (155 Wis 2d 24, 454 NW2d 742).",lexis

When the judge refused to resign from office notwithstanding his conviction and imprisonment, the United States House of Representatives adopted articles of impeachment which charged the judge with giving false testimony before the grand jury.

"A Michigan statute prohibited corporations from using corporate treasury funds for independent expenditures in support of or in opposition to any candidate in elections for state office. An ""independent"" expenditure was defined as one not made at the direction or under the control of another person, or to a committee working for or against a candidate. The statute allowed corporations to make such independent expenditures from only segregated funds used solely for political purposes. The statute exempted from its coverage expenditures by a broadcasting station, newspaper, magazine, or other periodical or publication for any news story, commentary, or editorial--in the regular course of publication or broadcasting--in support of or in opposition to a candidate for elective office. The validity of the statute was challenged by the Michigan State Chamber of Commerce, a nonprofit corporation with 8,000 members, three-quarters of whom were for-profit corporations. The chamber's general treasury was funded through annual dues required of all members. The chamber's purposes, as set out in its bylaws, included not only making expenditures for political purposes and performing other political activities, but also adding such activities as compiling and disseminating information relating to social, civic, and economic conditions, training and educating its members, and promoting ethical business practices. Although the chamber administered a segregated political fund, the chamber sought to use its general treasury funds for a newspaper advertisement in favor of a specific candidate for the Michigan House of Representatives.

A later disclaimer providing that nothing in the Resolution was intended to serve as a settlement of claims against the U.S., spoke only to those who might or might not have had claims against the U.S. There was no justification to turn an express disclaimer of claims against one sovereign into an affirmative recognition of claims against another. It was error for the state court to read that provision as recognizing claims inconsistent with the title held in ""absolute fee"" by the U.S. conveyed to the State at statehood. ""Whereas"" clauses were not operative and did not restructure rights and obligations. The Resolution did not indicate an intent to amend or repeal the right given to the State when it was admitted as a state.",lexis
"A radio in a restaurant received broadcasts of music and other normal radio programming, which broadcasts were heard, through four speakers in the ceiling, by the restaurant's owner, employees and customers. The station that broadcast songs heard at the restaurant was licensed by the American Society of Composers, Authors and Publishers (ASCAP), an association that licensed the performing rights of its members to their copyrighted works, but the restaurant owner did not hold such a license. The copyright holders on two songs that were received at the restaurant while customers were present, sued the restaurant owner in the United States District Court for the Western District of Pennsylvania, to recover for copyright infringement. The District Court held that the restaurant's reception of the licensed broadcasts infringed the copyright owners' exclusive rights to perform their copyrighted works in public for profit within the meaning of 1(e) of the Copyright Act (17 USCS 1(e)), and granted statutory awards for each infringement (356 F Supp 271).

"An individual was married to his first wife in 1949 when he began working for a company. The individual and his first wife had three sons during their marriage, which lasted until 1979, when the first wife died. In her will, the first wife (1) bequeathed to her husband (a) one-third of her estate, and (b) a lifetime usufruct--equivalent, under Louisiana law, to a common-law life estate--in the remaining two-thirds of her estate; and (2) bequeathed to her sons the naked ownership--equivalent to a common-law remainder--in the remaining two-thirds of her estate, subject to her husband's usufruct. In 1980, the individual married his second wife. In 1985, upon his retirement from the company, the individual received benefits from the company's retirement plans, which benefits included (1) a lump-sum distribution, which the individual rolled over into an individual retirement account (IRA); (2) shares of stock from the company's employee stock ownership plan (ESOP); and (3) a monthly annuity payment during his retirement. In 1989, the individual died. The individual's second wife began receiving monthly annuity payments from the company as the individual's surviving spouse. Thereafter, two of the individual's sons filed an action in state court to obtain a portion of the IRA, the ESOP shares, annuity payments received by the individual, and the second wife's survivor annuity payments, both received and payable. In response, the second wife filed an action in the United States District Court for the Eastern District of Louisiana against the individual's three sons and sought a declaratory judgment that the Employee Retirement Income Security Act of 1974 (ERISA) (29 USCS 1001 et seq.) pre-empted the application of Louisiana's community property and succession laws, to the extent that such state laws recognized the sons' claim to an interest in the retirement plan benefits. The District Court, rendering judgment in favor of the sons, ruled that (1) the first wife had an ownership interest in the retirement plan benefits under Louisiana community property law, and (2) ERISA did not pre-empt such law (849 F Supp 462, 1994 US Dist LEXIS 2776).

"The state of Arizona sought to impose its motor carrier license tax, assessed on the basis of a carrier's gross receipts, and its use fuel tax, assessed on the basis of diesel fuel used to propel a motor vehicle on any highway within the state, on a logging company, an enterprise consisting of two non-Indian corporations authorized to do the business in the state and operating solely on an Indian reservation by felling trees and transporting them to a tribal sawmill on state, Bureau of Indian Affairs, and tribal roads. The company paid the taxes under protest and then brought suit in state court, asserting that under federal law the taxes could not lawfully be imposed upon logging activities conducted exclusively on the reservation or upon hauling activities on Bureau of Indian Affairs and tribal roads. On cross motions, the trial court awarded summary judgment to the company. On appeal, the Arizona Court of Appeals reversed, holding that the taxes did not conflict with federal regulation of tribal timber, that the federal interest was not so dominant as to preclude assessment of the challenged state taxes, and that the federal regulatory scheme did not occupy the field, and concluded that the state taxes would not unlawfully infringe on tribal self-government (120 Ariz 282, 585 P2d 891), and the Arizona Supreme Court declined to review the decision.",lexis

It was alleged that (1) the accused had presented an undercover law enforcement officer, who was posing as a pawnshop dealer, with an offer to exchange the accused's MAC-10 machinegun and silencer for cocaine; and (2) the undercover officer had told the accused that the officer was not in the narcotics business, but that the officer was willing to see if he could track down some cocaine for a MAC-10. The accused was convicted on all counts, and was sentenced pursuant to 18 USCS 924(c)(1), which provides that whoever, during and in relation to any drug trafficking crime, uses a firearm that is a machinegun or is equipped with a silencer shall be sentenced to imprisonment for 30 years. The United States Court of Appeals for the Eleventh Circuit, in affirming on appeal, (1) rejected the argument that 924(c)(1) covered only situations in which the firearm is used as a weapon, and that the provision did not extend to persons who use a firearm solely as a medium of exchange or for barter; and (2) expressed the view that for purposes of 924(c)(1), any use of a firearm to facilitate in any manner the commission of the offense sufficed (957 F2d 835).",lexis
"The school's policies strictly prohibited the nonmedical use, possession, or sale of any drug on school grounds. Another student's statement that forbidden prescription and over-the-counter drugs came from the student was sufficiently plausible to warrant suspicion that the student was involved in pill distribution. This suspicion was enough to justify a search of the student's backpack and outer clothing. The student claimed that extending the search at the principal's behest to the point of making her pull out her underwear was constitutionally unreasonable. The principal knew beforehand that the pills were common pain relievers. What was missing from the suspected facts that pointed to the student was any indication of danger to the students from the power of the drugs or their quantity, and any reason to suppose that the student was carrying pills in her underwear. Thus, the Supreme Court held that the strip search of the student was unreasonable and a violation of the Fourth Amendment.

The laws of both states provided that the possessor could reclaim possession by posting a counterbond within 3 days after the seizure. In addition, the Florida statutes required that the person seeking replevin must file a complaint, and prosecute an action, for repossession, alleging in a conclusory fashion that he was ""lawfully entitled"" to possession, whereas the Pennsylvania laws required merely the filing of an affidavit of the value of the property, without requiring the institution of suit, although the possessor was authorized to initiate a lawsuit.

"The Fifteenth Amendment, so far as pertinent, provides that a citizen's right to vote shall not be denied or abridged by a state on account of race or color. The issue was whether this constitutional provision was violated by the practice of excluding Negroes from voting in the primaries of a Texas county political organization, under the following circumstances: The membership of the organization was limited to white people, who were automatically members if their names appeared on the official list of county voters. Apart from excluding Negroes, the voting qualifications were identical with those prescribed by Texas entitling electors to vote at county-operated primaries. The organization was run like other political parties. Its primaries were held prior to the primaries of the Democratic Party, and not on the date fixed by state law for primaries. The names of its nominees were put on the ballot in the Democratic primary without indication that they had been nominated by the organization. Persons not so nominated were free to enter as candidates in the Democratic primaries. However, with a few exceptions, the organization's nominees won without opposition in these primaries and the general elections that followed. The admitted purpose of the organization was to deny Negroes any voice in the election of county officials. In a class action instituted by Negro citizens of the county against officers of the organization for declaratory and injunctive relief, the defense was that the organization was not a political party, but a self-governing voluntary club, whose action was not state action within the Fifteenth Amendment.",lexis

The owner requested a variance, but the commission denied the request and made findings to the effect that (1) it was reasonable to assume that customers and employees of the future uses of the site could utilize a pedestrian/bicycle pathway adjacent to the development for transportation and recreational needs; (2) it was reasonable to expect that some users of the site's planned parking for bicycles would use the pedestrian/bicycle pathway if it were constructed; (3) creation of a convenient, safe pedestrian/bicycle pathway system as an alternative means of transportation could offset some of the traffic demand on nearby streets and lessen the increase in traffic congestion; and (4) based on an anticipated increase in stormwater flow, the requirement of dedication of the floodplain was related to the plan to intensify development. The commission's order was approved by the city council, subject to a minor modification regarding surveying. On appeal to a land use board of appeals, the owner claimed that the dedication requirements were not related to the proposed development, and therefore constituted an uncompensated taking of property in violation of the takings clause of the Federal Constitution's Fifth Amendment. The board, however, rejecting the takings claim, (1) assumed that the city's findings were supported by substantial evidence; and (2) expressed the view that there was a reasonable relationship between (a) the proposed development and the requirement to dedicate land along the creek for a greenway, and (b) the alleviation of the impacts of increased traffic and the facilitation of a pedestrian/bicycle pathway as an alternative means of transportation. The Oregon Court of Appeals, in affirming, rejected the owner's contention that the United States Supreme Court had abandoned the test of reasonable relationship in favor of a stricter test of essential nexus (113 Or App 162, 832 P2d 853).

On appeal, the United States Court of Appeals for the Federal Circuit, reversing, expressed the view that (1) under 271(e)(1), the second company's activities could not constitute infringement if the activities had been undertaken to develop information reasonably related to the development and submission of information necessary to obtain regulatory approval under the FDCA; and (2) the District Court should determine on remand whether that condition had been met (872 F2d 402).

"After a public hospital in Illinois fired a nurse who had worked in the hospital's obstetrics department, the nurse filed an internal grievance in which she claimed that (1) she had been fired because of a conversation that she had had with a second nurse at the hospital; and (2) in the conversation, she had criticized the hospital's cross-training policy and the staffing policies of the hospital's vice president of nursing. According to other hospital personnel, the fired nurse had complained about her department and her supervisor in the conversation and had discouraged the second nurse from transferring to the obstetrics department. The hospital's president rejected the grievance after meeting with the fired nurse, reviewing the written reports of the supervisor and the vice president, and having another hospital official interview the second nurse. The fired nurse subsequently brought suit under 42 USCS 1983 against the hospital, president, vice president, and supervisor in the United States District Court for the Central District of Illinois. Among the fired nurse's claims in the suit was that her speech had been protected under the Federal Constitution's First Amendment and that the firing had thus violated her First Amendment rights. The fired nurse produced evidence to the effect that she had criticized the cross-training policy prior to the conversation in question, and that the hospital management might have been hostile to her because of the criticisms. The District Court, in granting summary judgment to the defendants on the free speech claim, expressed the view that (1) the fired nurse's speech was not protected under the First Amendment as a matter of law; and (2) even if the speech were so protected, the hospital's interest in maintaining workplace harmony outweighed the fired nurse's interest in expressing her opposition to the cross-training policy to her coworker. The United States Court of Appeals for the Seventh Circuit, in reversing and remanding, concluded that (1) there were genuine issues of material fact in dispute regarding the content of the fired nurse's speech; (2) when a public employer fires an employee for engaging in speech which is later found to be protected under the First Amendment, the employer is liable for violating the employee's free speech rights regardless of what the employer knew about the speech at the time of the termination; and (3) if, on remand, the jury were to determine that the point of the fired nurse's conversation was to raise the issue of inadequate nurse staffing because of the cross-training policy, rather than simply to complain, then the fired nurse was engaged in protected conduct (977 F2d 1114).",lexis
"While serving as a volunteer teacher at a ""Freedom School"" for Negro children in Hattiesburg, Mississippi, a white woman from New York entered a store restaurant with six of her students for the purpose of eating lunch. A waitress took the students' orders, but refused to serve the teacher because she was a white person in the company of Negroes. Upon her departure from the store, the teacher was arrested by the Hattiesburg police on a charge of vagrancy. She brought suit in the United States District Court for the Southern District of New York against the store to recover damages under 42 USC 1983, which provides a civil action for the deprivation of civil rights ""under color of any statute, ordinance, regulation, custom or usage, of any State or Territory."" The first count of the complaint alleged that the store's refusal to serve the teacher violated her right under the equal protection clause of the Fourteenth Amendment not to be discriminated against on the basis of race, since the refusal had been pursuant to a custom of the community to segregate races in public eating places. Because the teacher was unable to prove at the trial that there were other instances in Hattiesburg of a white person having been refused service while in the company of Negroes, the District Court directed a verdict in favor of the store. The second count of the complaint, alleging that both the refusal of service and the subsequent arrest had been the product of a conspiracy between the store and the police to violate the teacher's right to equal protection of the laws, was dismissed before trial on a motion for summary judgment for failure ""to allege any facts from which a conspiracy might be inferred.""

"In the instant cases, one of the questions presented was whether conscientious objection to a particular war, rather than objection to all war, relieved the objector from military service responsibilities under the provision of 6(j) of the Military Selective Service Act of 1967 exempting registrants ""conscientiously opposed to participation in war in any form,"" and under administrative regulations incorporating the same standards for conscientious-objector discharges of servicemen. Another issue presented was whether limitation of conscientious-objector status only to those who objected to all wars violated the religious clauses of the First Amendment. In No. 85, conscientious objector status was administratively denied to a draft registrant who, on the basis of a humanist approach to religion and fundamental principles of conscience, objected to participation in the Vietnam war as being unjust, but not to participation in a war of national defense or a war sponsored by the United Nations as a peace-keeping measure. The registrant was subsequently convicted in the United States District Court for the Southern District of New York for wilful failure to report for induction, the District Court having determined that there was a basis in fact to support the denial of the conscientious-objector exemption, since the registrant's objection ran only to a particular war. The United States Court of Appeals for the Second Circuit affirmed the conviction (420 F2d 298). In No. 325, the Army denied an application for a conscientious-objector discharge which had been made by a soldier after completion of basic training and receipt of orders for Vietnam duty, and which was based on objection to the Vietnam war but not to all wars. Such objection was founded on the soldier's duty under the Catholic faith to forswear participation in an ""unjust"" war. The United States District Court for the Northern District of California denied habeas corpus relief to the soldier, finding a basis in fact for the Army's rejection of the application for discharge, and the United States Court of Appeals for the Ninth Circuit affirmed on the ground that objection to the Vietnam war, but not to all wars, did not qualify the soldier for discharge (418 F2d 908).",lexis

In September 1984, the dealer brought an action against the manufacturer in the United States District Court for the Northern District of Alabama, on both diversity of citizenship and federal question jurisdictional grounds, alleging breach of the dealership contract, breach of warranty, fraud, and federal antitrust violations arising out of the dealer-manufacturer contractual relationship. In response, the manufacturer moved, pursuant to the forum-selection clause, to transfer the action under 28 USCS 1404(a) to the United States District Court for the Southern District of New York, which is located in Manhattan. The District Court denied the manufacturer's motion to transfer, refusing to enforce the forum-selection clause, based in part on its conclusion that state law--in this case, Alabama law, which deemed such clauses contrary to public policy--governed the clause's enforceability.

"As the result of a dispute over control of the American-Canadian Diocese of the Serbian Orthodox Church, a hierarchical church whose Seat is the Patriarchate in Belgrade, Yugoslavia, the church, acting through its hierarchical bodies, suspended, removed, and ultimately defrocked the bishop of the diocese, and reorganized the diocese into three dioceses. During the progress of the church dispute, the bishop and others filed a suit in the Circuit Court of Lake County, Illinois, to have himself declared the true bishop of the diocese, and to enjoin church officials from interfering with the assets of corporations that had been organized to hold church property in the diocese. The defendants filed a counter-complaint, which was consolidated with the original action, seeking a declaratory judgment that the plaintiff had been removed as bishop of the diocese and that the diocese had been properly reorganized. After a lengthy trial, the trial court concluded that no substantial evidence had been produced of fraud, collusion, or arbitrariness as to the bishop's defrockment, but that the church had acted improperly in reorganizing the diocese. The Supreme Court of Illinois affirmed in part and reversed in part, holding that (1) the church's suspension, removal, and defrockment of the bishop must be set aside as arbitrary because the church proceedings against him had not been conducted in accordance with the court's interpretation of the church's constitution, penal code, and internal regulations, and (2) the church's reorganization of the diocese was beyond the scope of the church's authority to effectuate such changes without approval of the diocese (60 Ill 2d 477, 328 NE2d 268).",lexis
"Under 18 USCS 922(d)(4), it is unlawful for a licensed firearms dealer to sell firearms to a person who has been adjudicated a mental defective or committed to a mental institution. Other federal firearms disabilities related to mental capacity or institutional commitment are contained in 18 USCS 922(g), 922(h), and 18 USCS Appx 1202(a)(1), 1202(a)(3). In 1982, after a customer, who had been involuntarily committed to a mental hospital for several days in 1971, answered affirmatively as to whether he had been committed to a mental hospital, a store in New Jersey refused to sell a firearm to the customer, in accordance with 922(d)(4). Under 18 USCS 925(c) (later amended) as it then read, certain former felons could apply to the United States Treasury's Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco and Firearms for administrative relief, but no such relief was then available to former mental patients. When the Bureau therefore rejected the customer's request for a special exemption from federal firearms disabilities, the customer filed suit in the United States District Court for the District of New Jersey, challenging the constitutionality of the federal firearms legislation. The District Court concluded that those portions of the federal firearms statutes which deprived the customer of his ability to purchase a firearm were unconstitutional under the Fifth Amendment, for (1) the statutory scheme violated equal protection principles due to the lack of a rational basis for singling out mental patients for permanent firearms-disability status, particularly as compared to convicts; and (2) the statutory scheme unconstitutionally created an irrebuttable presumption that one who had been committed, no matter what the circumstances, was forever mentally ill and dangerous (602 F Supp 682). After the United States Supreme Court noted probable jurisdiction of the Federal Government's appeal of the decision, and the case had been argued, Congress passed a statute (Firearm Owners' Protection Act, PL 99-308, 100 Stat 449) which (1) amended 18 USCS 925(c) to permit administrative relief by the Secretary of the Treasury from firearms disabilities to any person who was prohibited under the federal statutes from possessing, shipping, transporting, or receiving firearms or ammunition (100 Stat 449, 105); and (2) made this amendment applicable to any pending action, petition, or appellate proceeding (100 Stat 449, 110).",lexis

"A prisoner who had been convicted of murdering a guard during a previous escape attempt was aided in a second attempt by members of his family, including two of his sons, who smuggled guns into the prison and helped the prisoner and his cellmate, also a convicted murderer, to overpower their guards. After the getaway car developed a flat tire, the group decided to stop and steal a passing car, and one of the sons flagged down some passing motorists, who were then held by the group at gunpoint, robbed of their valuables, and taken out into the desert with both cars. While the sons fetched some water for their captives from the second car, the prisoner and his cellmate, who were holding the captives by the adjacent first car, fatally shot the captives. Neither of the sons made any effort to aid the victims, though they later claimed to have been surprised by the shootings; and they continued to participate in the escape effort, which later ended in a shootout with police. In Arizona state court proceedings based on Arizona's felony-murder and accomplice-liability laws, the two sons were convicted of murder and sentenced to death for the killing of the motorists. The Supreme Court of Arizona affirmed the death sentences, holding that the fact that the sons had not specifically intended that the motorists be killed nor actually done the killing was of little significance in view of the fact that they had associated themselves with known killers and were palpably indifferent to the consequences of their actions (129 Ariz 526, 633 P2d 335; 129 Ariz 546, 633 P2d 355).

In 1984, the Florida corporation filed an action against a Tennessee corporation in the Circuit Court of Orange County, Florida, for an injunction, an accounting of profits, damages, and attorney's fees, under a 1983 Florida statute which made it unlawful, without the consent of the manufacturer, to use the ""direct molding process""--a form of reverse engineering--to duplicate for the purpose of sale any manufactured vessel hull or component part thereof, or knowingly to sell any such duplicates.

In 1980, the reorganization court concluded that reorganization was not possible and it directed the trustee of the railroad estate to prepare a plan for liquidation. Subsequently, various railroads and labor organizations representing employees of the bankrupt railroad reached an agreement as to railroad employees hired by carriers acquiring the railroad's trackage, the agreement covering such matters as hiring preferences, monetary protection, and seniority, but not covering those employees who were not employed by acquiring carriers. Subsequently, the railroad trustee petitioned the reorganization court to confirm the railroad's abandonment of all rail lines in operation. The court then ordered the total abandonment of the railroad system and the discontinuance of its service and concluded, among other things, that it would not allow nor require any claim or arrangement of any kind or nature for employee labor protection payable out of the assets of the railroad's estate. In the meantime Congress had responded to the crisis resulting from the demise of the railroad by enacting the Rock Island Transition and Employee Assistance Act (45 USCS 1001 et seq.) which was signed into law three days before the reorganization court's abandonment order. Sections 106 and 110 of the Act (45 USCS 1005, 1008) were employee protection provisions which required that the railroad trustee provide economic benefits to those railroad employees who were not hired by other carriers, that benefits be paid from the estate's assets, and that employee benefit obligations be considered administrative expenses of the railroad estate for purposes of determining the priority of the employees' claims to the assets of the estate upon liquidation. A complaint was filed in the court seeking to declare the Act unconstitutional and to enjoin its enforcement. The court then issued a preliminary injunction prohibiting the enforcement of 106 and 110, concluding that the employee protection provisions constituted an uncompensated taking of private property for a public purpose in violation of the just compensation clause of the Fifth Amendment, and the District Court's order was appealed to the United States Supreme Court. Congress responded to the court's injunction by enacting 701 of the Staggers Rail Act of 1980 (94 Stat 1959), which, with certain modifications, reenacted 106 and 110 of the Rock Island Act and amended that Act to provide a remedy if the labor protection provisions were found to constitute a taking. A motion was filed with the reorganization court to vacate its injunction on the basis that the passage of the Staggers Act rendered the injunction moot.

In 1990, a customer purchased one of the manufacturer's cars for $ 40,750.88 from an authorized dealer in Birmingham, Alabama. Prior to the car's transport to the dealer, the car had been partially repainted at the distributor's vehicle preparation center at a cost of $ 601.37, which was about 1.5 percent of the car's suggested retail price. The customer drove the car for approximately 9 months without noticing any flaws in its appearance before taking the car to an independent automobile detailing shop. The proprietor of the shop detected evidence that the car had been repainted and informed the customer. Thereafter, the customer brought an action in an Alabama trial court against the distributor and alleged that the failure to disclose that the car had been repainted constituted suppression of a material fact. At trial before a jury, the customer claimed that (1) his actual damages were $ 4,000, in that the value of one of the manufacturer's repainted cars was approximately 10 percent less than the value of a new car that had not been damaged and repaired; and (2) a punitive damages award of $ 4 million would provide an appropriate penalty, using the $ 4,000 actual damages estimate, in that since 1983, the manufacturer had sold as new 983 cars which had been repainted at a cost of more than $ 300 per vehicle, including 14 in Alabama. The jury--based on its determination that the nationwide policy of nondisclosure constituted gross, oppressive, or malicious fraud for purposes of Alabama statutes which authorized punitive damages--returned a verdict which awarded the customer $ 4,000 in compensatory damages and $ 4 million in punitive damages. The distributor promptly amended its nationwide policy so as to require full disclosure of all repairs. Following the trial court's denial of the distributor's motion to set aside the punitive damages award, the distributor appealed. The Supreme Court of Alabama expressed the view that (1) a jury could not use the number of similar acts that a defendant had committed in other jurisdictions as a multiplier when determining the dollar amount of a punitive damages award, (2) a constitutionally reasonable punitive damages award in the case at hand was $ 2 million, and (3) accordingly, the trial court's judgment would be affirmed on condition that the customer file a remittitur in the amount of $ 2 million (646 So 2d 619)..",lexis
"While conversing privately with her coemployee boyfriend in an office not generally accessible to the public, a deputy county constable, who was not a law enforcement officer, but rather a clerical employee whose duties did not generally involve contact with the public, heard a radio report of an attempt to assassinate the President of the United States and responded by criticizing the President's policies and stating that ""if they go for him again, I hope they get him."" This remark was overheard by another employee, who the deputy had not known to be present, and was reported to the constable, who questioned the deputy, got her to acknowledge making the remark, and then fired her. Alleging that the constable had violated her constitutional rights under color of state law by discharging her, the deputy brought suit against the constable and the county under 42 USCS 1983 in the United States District Court for the Southern District of Texas. The District Court granted summary judgment in favor of the constable and the county on the ground that the deputy's remark was not protected speech under the First Amendment. The United States Court of Appeals for the Fifth Circuit vacated the judgment of the District Court and remanded for resolution of factual issues (736 F2d 175). After trial on remand, the District Court again ruled that the remark was not protected speech. The Court of Appeals, however, (1) held that the deputy could not constitutionally be fired for her remark, since (a) the remark addressed matters of public concern and (b) the deputy's position was so utterly ministerial that the First Amendment interest in protecting her freedom of expression was not outweighed by any serious potential for disrupting the mission of the constable's office; and accordingly (2) reversed and remanded for determination of an appropriate remedy (786 F2d 1233).",lexis

In a class action instituted by a female applicant for a guard position who had been rejected for failing to meet the minimum weight requirement, a three-judge United States District Court for the Middle District of Alabama held that the Alabama statute and regulation were invalid as violating Title VII's proscription of sex discrimination (418 F Supp 1169).",lexis

Raising various constitutional objections and asserting that they were organized for a permissible purpose only, the organizations, in separate proceedings, sued the Attorney General for declaratory and injunctive relief, seeking the deletion of their names from the list because of the resulting harm to their activities.

"Between October 2, 1984, and October 1, 1987, a Texas sales and use tax provided an exemption for periodicals that were published or distributed by a religious faith and that consisted wholly of writings promulgating the teaching of the faith, and for books that consisted wholly of writings sacred to a religious faith. The exemption was challenged by a publisher which was not a religious faith and whose publication, a general-interest magazine, did not contain only articles promulgating the teaching of a religious faith. In 1985, the publisher paid sales taxes under protest and sued to recover them in state court. The District Court of Travis County, Texas, held that an exclusive exemption for religious periodicals was prohibited under the establishment of religion clause of the Federal Constitution's First Amendment and was also unconstitutional as discriminating on the basis of the content of publications. Accordingly, the District Court struck down the tax as applied to nonreligious periodicals and ordered the state to refund the publisher's tax payments plus interest. The Court of Appeals of Texas, Third District, reversed, holding that the exemption (1) served the secular purpose of preserving separation between church and state, (2) did not have the primary effect of advancing or inhibiting religion, and (3) did not produce impermissible government entanglement with religion (731 SW2d 160). The Court of Appeals also held that the exemption did not violate the free press guaranty of the Federal Constitution's First Amendment.",lexis

"Massachusetts issued a pricing order imposing an assessment on all fluid milk sold by milk dealers to Massachusetts retailers. The order, which was designed to aid only Massachusetts milk producers, required dealers to pay into a fund monthly payments that were determined by subtracting from $ 15 the monthly federal blend price for 100 pounds of raw milk. Although approximately two-thirds of such milk was produced outside Massachusetts, the entire fund was distributed monthly to Massachusetts dairy farmers according to each farmer's proportionate contribution to the state's total production of raw milk. After two licensed Massachusetts milk dealers, who sold to Massachusetts retailers milk that was produced outside Massachusetts, refused to make the payments required under the pricing order, Massachusetts commenced license revocation proceedings against the dealers. The dealers then sought an injunction against enforcement of the order on the ground that the order violated the Federal Constitution's commerce clause (Art I, 8, cl 3). The Superior Court of Suffolk County, Massachusetts, denied relief, and a Massachusetts official conditionally revoked the dealers' licenses. The Supreme Judicial Court of Massachusetts, expressing the view that the local benefits provided to the Massachusetts dairy industry by the pricing order outweighed any incidental burden on interstate commerce, affirmed the Superior Court judgment (415 Mass 8, 611 NE2d 239).",lexis

"After the discovery of the body of a taxicab driver who had died from a shotgun blast, and after another taxicab driver who had been robbed by a man wielding a sawed-off shotgun identified his assailant on the basis of photographs in a police station, a police patrolman spotted the man whose picture had been identified in the area of a school for handicapped children. The man, who was unarmed at the time, was then arrested and advised of his rights under Miranda v Arizona (1966) 384 US 436, 16 L Ed 2d 694, 86 S Ct 1602. Within minutes of the arrest, other police arrived on the scene, including a police sergeant and captain, both of whom again advised the suspect of his Miranda rights. After the suspect stated that he understood his Miranda rights and wanted to speak with a lawyer, the captain directed that the suspect be placed in a police car and driven to the police station accompanied by three patrolmen. While the police car was proceeding to its destination, two of the patrolmen conversed with each other concerning the possibility that one of the handicapped children from the nearby school might find a weapon with shells and get hurt. The suspect, overhearing the conversation, told the officers to turn the car around so that he could show them where a shotgun was located. Interrupting the trip to the police station after the car had been on the road for only a few minutes, the police returned to the scene of the arrest where a search for the shotgun was in progress. On arrival, the suspect was again advised of his Miranda rights. He replied that he understood his rights, but ""wanted to get the gun out of the way because of the kids in the area in the school."" The man then led the police to a nearby field where he pointed out a shotgun. Subsequently, upon being indicted for the kidnapping, robbery, and murder of the deceased taxicab driver, the man was convicted of such offenses in the Superior Court of Kent, County, Rhode Island, at a trial in which the shotgun and the testimony relating to its discovery had been admitted into evidence. On appeal, the Supreme Court of Rhode Island set aside the conviction, holding, among other things, that the defendant had invoked his right to counsel at the time of his arrest, and that, contrary to the mandate of the Miranda case that, in the absence of counsel, all custodial interrogation then cease, the police officers who had carried on the conversation about a handicapped child finding a gun had interrogated the defendant without a valid waiver of his right to counsel (____ RI ____, 391 A2d 1158).",lexis

The Department denied the request with respect to the three brothers who were still living, but released the ""rap sheet,"" or criminal identification record, of the fourth, deceased brother. The correspondent and the association, seeking to compel fuller disclosure but limiting their request to documents containing information that was a matter of public record, filed suit in the United States District Court for the District of Columbia. While the suit was pending, two more of the brothers died, and the FBI (1) released the requested data concerning those brothers, (2) indicated that any financial crime information about the remaining brother could be disclosed in the public interest, but that no such information existed, and (3) refused to release any rap sheet or other records containing nonfinancial criminal information about the remaining brother. The District Court, granting the Department's motion for summary judgment after an in camera review of the requested information, held that such information was exempted from FOIA's disclosure requirements by various FOIA provisions, including Exemption 7(C) (5 USCS 552(b)(7)(C)), which applies to investigatory records compiled for law enforcement purposes where production of such records could reasonably be expected to constitute an unwarranted invasion of personal privacy. The United States Court of Appeals for the District of Columbia Circuit reversed and remanded (259 App DC 426, 816 F2d 730), holding that (1) Exemption 7(C) was inapplicable, because, in the absence of any statutory standards by which to judge the public interest in disclosure, a court should be bound by state and local determinations that such information should be made available to the general public, and (2) no other FOIA exemptions were applicable. Accordingly, the Court of Appeals directed the District Court to determine, on remand, whether the withheld information was publicly available at its source, and if so, whether the Department might satisfy its statutory obligation by referring the journalists to the enforcement agency or agencies that had provided the original information. On rehearing, the Court of Appeals, modifying its holding, said that most state policies in fact did not favor disclosure of rap sheets, but that the District Court should nonetheless make a factual determination whether the remaining brother's privacy interest in his rap-sheet information had faded because such information appeared on the public record (265 App DC 365, 831 F2d 1124).

"The Secretary of Labor, to whom the Occupational Safety and Health Act (29 USCS 651 et seq.) delegates broad authority for promulgating occupational safety and health standards (defined in 3(8) of the Act (29 USCS 652(8)) as standards which are ""reasonably necessary or appropriate to provide safe or healthful employment and places of employment""), believing that no safe human exposure level can be determined when a cancer-causing toxic material or harmful physical agent is to be regulated in a standard, took the position that under 6(b)(5) of the Act (29 USCS 655(b)(5))--which directs the Secretary, ""in promulgating standards dealing with toxic materials or harmful physical agents,"" to ""set the standard which most adequately assures, to the extent feasible, on the basis of the best available evidence, that no employee will suffer material impairment of health or functional capacity""--a standard for such a carcinogenic material or agent had to be such that the level of human exposure to the carcinogen was set at the lowest technologically feasible level that would not impair the viability of industries regulated by the standard. In accordance with such position, the Secretary, upon determining that there was a causal connection between the toxic substance benzene (a rapidly-evaporating, aromatic liquid produced by the petroleum and petrochemical industries for use in manufacturing motor fuels, solvents, detergents, pesticides, and other organic chemicals) and leukemia (a cancer attacking man's white blood cells), promulgated a standard for benzene which reduced the permissible exposure limit on airborne concentrations of benzene from the consensus standard of ten parts benzene per million parts of air to one part benzene per million parts of air, and also restricted dermal contact with solutions containing benzene. Subsequently, on pre-enforcement review pursuant to a provision of the Act governing the judicial review of occupational safety and health standards (29 USCS 655(f)), the United States Court of Appeals for the Fifth Circuit held that the benzene standard was invalid, the Court of Appeals ruling that (1) the Secretary of Labor had exceeded his standard-setting authority because it had not been shown that the benzene exposure limit was ""reasonably necessary or appropriate to provide safe or healthful employment,"" as required by 3(8) of the Act, and because 6(b)(5) of the Act did not give the Secretary unbridled discretion to adopt standards designed to create absolutely risk-free workplaces regardless of costs, and (2) the Secretary was under a duty, arising from 3(8) and 6(b)(5) of the Act, to determine whether the expected benefits from the new standard bore a reasonable relationship to the costs that it imposed (581 F2d 493).",lexis
"Under Rule 606(b) of the Federal Rules of Evidence, juror testimony normally cannot be used to impeach a jury verdict, except when certain outside influences on the jury are involved. A Florida corporation which was owned and operated by 11 rural electric distribution co-operatives borrowed money--guaranteed by the Rural Electrification Administration (REA)--from the Federal Financing Bank (FFB), in order to construct a powerplant. After problems developed, the procurement manager of the corporation and an outside contractor for the project were indicted, tried in the United States District Court for the Middle District of Florida, and eventually convicted, on charges of (1) conspiring to defraud the United States in violation of 18 USCS 371, and (2) committing mail fraud in violation of 18 USCS 1341. The defendants filed a motion for a new trial and other relief, based upon an affidavit that a juror had informed a defense attorney that several jurors consumed alcohol during some of the trial's lunch breaks, causing the jurors to sleep through the afternoons. After an evidentiary hearing, however, the District Court denied any relief, expressing the view that (1) juror testimony on intoxication was inadmissible under Rule 606(b) to impeach the jury's verdict, and (2) there was insufficient nonjuror evidence as to juror misconduct. While the appeal of the case was pending, the defendants filed another new trial motion--based upon a second juror's statements as to the use of alcohol, marijuana, and cocaine during the trial--but the District Court (1) declined to hold another evidentiary hearing, (2) denied the motion, and (3) expressed the view that the motion contained supplemental allegations which differed quantitatively, but not qualitatively, from the previous allegations. On appeal, the United States Court of Appeals for the Eleventh Circuit affirmed the convictions of both defendants, expressing the view that (1) the District Court was under no duty to investigate the allegations with respect to the second motion for new trial, and did not abuse its discretion in refusing to conduct an evidentiary hearing; (2) the indictment charged and the evidence established a conspiracy to defraud the United States under 371, where (a) the money used to construct the powerplant was borrowed from the FFB, an agency of the United States, (b) the loan was guaranteed by the REA, an agency of the United States, and (c) the United States' fundamental interest extended to seeing that the entire project was administered honestly and efficiently and without corruption and waste; and (3) the 1341 convictions also ought to be affirmed, because the evidence established the use of the mails in connection with the 371 violation (772 F2d 765).",lexis

"The defendant was indicted for first degree murder under North Carolina statutes which, at the time, provided that the penalty upon conviction was death unless the jury recommended life imprisonment, and that upon acceptance of a guilty plea to first degree murder, the penalty would be life imprisonment. Upon the defendant's plea of guilty to the reduced charge of second degree murder, the trial court heard the defendant's testimony that although he had not committed the murder, he was pleading guilty, as recommended by court-appointed counsel who had explained the consequences of the plea and the rights waived thereby, in order to avoid a possible death penalty upon a jury conviction of first degree murder, and to limit the penalty to the 30-year maximum sentence provided by statute for second degree murder. Before accepting the guilty plea, the trial court heard further testimony which strongly indicated the defendant's guilt. After being sentenced to 30 years' imprisonment, and after earlier unsuccessful attempts to obtain postconviction relief in both state and federal courts, the defendant petitioned for a writ of habeas corpus in the United States District Court for the Middle District of North Carolina, which denied relief on the ground that the defendant's guilty plea was voluntary.

After the accused's subsequent arrest and indictment for possession of narcotics, a District of Columbia trial court, on the basis of the alleged narcotics offense, found the accused guilty of criminal contempt for violating his release terms. The accused later moved to dismiss the narcotics indictment on the ground that the indictment violated the double jeopardy clause of the Federal Constitution's Fifth Amendment, and the trial court granted the motion.

The United States Attorney's Office later obtained an indictment charging the second accused with simple assault on one occasion (Count I), threatening to injure another on three other occasions (Counts II-IV), and assault with intent to kill on yet another occasion (Count V), where Counts I and V were based on the events for which the accused had been held in contempt and Counts II-IV were based on the events for which he had been acquitted of contempt.

The District of Columbia Court of Appeals consolidated the two cases and, relying on the decision by the United States Supreme Court in Grady v Corbin (1990) 495 US 508, 109 L Ed 2d 548, 110 S Ct 2084--which announced a double jeopardy test under which a subsequent prosecution was prohibited if, to establish an essential element of an offense charged in that prosecution, the government would prove conduct that constituted an offense for which the accused already had been prosecuted--held that in both cases the subsequent prosecutions were barred by the double jeopardy clause (598 A2d 724).",lexis
"Two national banks, which were the wholly owned subsidiaries of a holding company, arranged credit life insurance for their borrowers by completing the necessary forms, delivering the insurance certificates, collecting the premiums or adding them to the borrowers' loans, and forwarding the completed forms and premiums to an independent insurance company. The latter reinsured the policies with the holding company's subsidiary insurance company, which received 85 percent of the premiums. Pursuant to his authority under 26 USC 482 to allocate gross income among controlled corporations to reflect the actual incomes of corporations, the Commissioner of Internal Revenue allocated 40 percent of the subsidiary insurance company's premium income to the banks as compensation for originating and processing the insurance.

"Upon filing a joint federal income tax return with his wife, a New Jersey state police trooper included in gross income only part of cash meal allowances received by the trooper from the state. Such cash payments by the state to its troopers were (1) designated as meal allowances, (2) paid biweekly in advance with the trooper's salary, (3) separately stated and accounted for in the state's accounting system, and (4) varied in amount, in accordance with the trooper's rank. The troopers remained on call in their patrol areas during their mid-shift break, but were not restricted as to where they might eat in the patrol area and were not required to either spend the allowance on meals or account for the manner in which the money was spent. On audit of the trooper's return, the Commissioner of Internal Revenue determined that the entire amount of meal allowances should have been included as income, and a deficiency was assessed. The trooper sought review in the United States Tax Court, which held that (1) the cash meal payments were income under 61(a) of the Internal Revenue Code of 1954 (26 USCS 61(a)), which provides that gross income means all income from whatever source derived, including compensation for services, fees, commissions, and similar items, and (2) such payments were not excludable from gross income under 119 of the Code (26 USCS 119), which authorizes an employee to exclude from gross income the value of any meals furnished to him by his employer, for the convenience of the employer, but only if the meals are furnished on the employer's business premises, and which provides that in determining whether meals are furnished for the convenience of the employer, the provisions of an employment contract or of a state statute fixing terms of employment shall not be determinative of whether the meals are intended as compensation (65 T Ct 44).

Thus, according to the lower court, the state court finding of a lack of prejudice from the buttons was contrary to, or an unreasonable application of, clearly established federal law within the meaning of 28 U.S.C.S. ¬¨√ü 2254(d)(1). The U.S. Supreme Court held, however, that the Court did not previously consider whether spectator conduct at trial was inherently prejudicial, and thus there was no clearly established federal law for the state court to apply. The Court's previous considerations of prejudicial courtroom conduct involved only state action, and the Court never held that the test for prejudice from state conduct was equally applicable to spectator conduct. Therefore, the state's denial of relief to the inmate could not be in conflict with clearly established federal law.",lexis
"This case presented federal income tax questions relating to inventory accounting procedures and additions to bad debt reserves. For the tax year 1964, a taxpayer which manufactured tools reported a net operating loss upon claiming an offset against 1964 sales of the taxpayer's write-down of its ""excess"" inventory (consisting mostly of spare parts for tools) to its net realizable value (scrap value for the most part), even though the taxpayer continued to hold the goods for sale at their original prices. The Commissioner of Internal Revenue disallowed the offset, concluding that the write-down of ""excess"" inventory did not ""clearly reflect"" the taxpayer's 1964 income and thus did not satisfy the inventory-accounting requirements of 26 USCS 446, 471 and implementing regulations ( 26 CFR 1.446-1, 1.471-2, 1.471-4). In 1965, the taxpayer added to its reserve for bad debts, and asserted as a deduction, a sum that presupposed a substantially higher bad debt chargeoff rate than the taxpayer had experienced in immediately preceding years. The Commissioner ruled that the claimed addition to the bad debt reserve was not ""reasonable"" under 26 USCS 166(c), and recomputed the addition according to a formula based on the taxpayer's recent chargeoff history. On the taxpayer's petition for redetermination, the Tax Court upheld the Commissioner's exercise of discretion in both respects (64 T Ct 154), and the United States Court of Appeals for the Seventh Circuit affirmed (563 F2d 861).",lexis

Asserting federal question jurisdiction under 28 USCS 1331 and 1362, the plaintiffs alleged that the 1795 cession, made without the consent of the United States, was ineffective to terminate the plaintiffs' right to possession of the land under earlier federal treaties confirming the plaintiffs' possessory right until terminated by the United States, and under the Nonintercourse Act of 1790 (1 Stat 137), forbidding the conveyance of Indian lands without the consent of the United States. The District Court dismissed the complaint for want of federal question jurisdiction, and the United States Court of Appeals for the Second Circuit affirmed, holding that the complaint alleged a cause of action based on the right to possession of property under state law, and that the possible necessity of interpreting federal law to resolve a potential defense was insufficient to sustain federal question jurisdiction (464 F2d 916).",lexis

In No. 50 defendant's claim to exemption as conscientious objector was denied after he, professing religious belief and faith and not disavowing, although not clearly demonstrating, any belief in a relation to a Supreme Being, stated that ""the cosmic order does, perhaps, suggest a creative intelligence"" and decried the tremendous ""spiritual"" price man must pay for his willingness to destroy human life.

Without specific concentration on the facts of these cases, the Supreme Court of the United States, in an opinion by Warren, Ch. J., expressing the views of five members of the Court, laid down the governing principles, the most important of which is that, as a constitutional prerequisite to the admissibility of such statements, the suspect must, in the absence of a clear, intelligent waiver of the constitutional rights involved, be warned prior to questioning that he has a right to remain silent, that any statement he does make may be used as evidence against him, and that he has a right to the presence of an attorney, either retained or appointed.

"A Massachusetts statute requiring parental consent before an abortion could be performed on an unmarried woman under the age of 18, but providing that an abortion could be obtained under a court order upon a showing of good cause if one or both parents should refuse consent, was challenged as violating the United States Constitution in an action brought in the United States District Court for the District of Massachusetts. After a three-judge District Court held the statute unconstitutional and permanently enjoined its enforcement (393 F Supp 847), direct appeals were taken to the United States Supreme Court. The Supreme Court vacated and remanded, holding that the District Court should have abstained from deciding the constitutionality of the statute and instead certified pertinent questions to the Massachusetts Supreme Judicial Court for a determination concerning the meaning of the challenged law (49 L Ed 2d 844). On remand, the District Court certified several questions to the highest court of Massachusetts. Among the questions asked were (1) whether the statute permitted any minors, mature or immature, to obtain judicial consent to an abortion without any parental consultation whatsoever, and (2) whether a court whose assistance was sought in obtaining an abortion could refuse its consent if it found a minor to be capable of making an informed and reasonable decision to have an abortion, but found that a parent's, or its own, contrary decision were a better one. With respect to the first question the Supreme Judicial Court answered that in general the law did not permit minors to obtain judicial consent to an abortion without any parental consent whatsoever, that consent had to be obtained for every nonemergency abortion unless there were no parent available, and that an available parent had to be given notice of any judicial proceedings brought by a minor to obtain consent for an abortion. With regard to the second question, the Massachusetts court answered affirmatively (371 Mass 741, 360 NE2d 288). Following the Supreme Judicial Court's decision, the District Court again declared the statute unconstitutional and enjoined its enforcement (450 F Supp 997).",lexis
"A member of Jehovah's Witnesses was employed in a roll foundry which produced sheet steel for various industrial uses. Subsequently the foundry closed and he was transferred to another department which produced turrets for military tanks. The production of armaments being contrary to the employee's religious beliefs, and all departments to which he might have been transferred being likewise engaged in the production of armaments, he asked to be laid off. The request was denied, and the employee then quit his job. His application for unemployment compensation benefits under the Indiana Employment Security Act was denied after a hearing at which the employee explained that his religious beliefs would not allow him to contribute directly to the production of weapons, but that he could, in good conscience, engage in the production of raw materials which might ultimately be used to fabricate weapons. The denial was based on the ground that although the employee did, in fact, terminate his employment because of religious convictions, his voluntary termination was not for ""good cause arising in connection with his work"" pursuant to the Indiana statute. The Employment Security Review Board affirmed, but the Indiana Court of Appeals reversed, holding that the Indiana statute, as applied, unduly burdened the employee's free exercise of his religion (65 Ind Dec 238, 381 NE2d 888). The Indiana Supreme Court vacated the Court of Appeals' decision, holding that the employee's reason for voluntarily terminating his employment was more a personal philosophical choice rather than a religious belief, that quitting for religious reasons would nevertheless not suffice as ""good cause,"" that, in denying benefits, any burden placed on the employee's right to free exercise of his religion was indirect and justified by legitimate state interests, and that the extension of benefits would violate the establishment clause of the First Amendment (391 NE2d 1127).",lexis

The District Court (1) applied a strict-scrutiny standard to both regulations; (2) found that, under the First Amendment to the United States Constitution, the correspondence regulation (a) was invalid as unnecessarily sweeping, and (b) had been applied in an arbitrary and capricious manner; and (3) also ruled that the marriage regulation unconstitutionally infringed upon the inmates' fundamental right to marry, because the regulation was more restrictive than was either reasonable or essential (586 F Supp 589). On appeal, the United States Court of Appeals for the Eighth Circuit (1) affirmed the District Court's (a) use of a strict-scrutiny standard, and (b) invalidation of the correspondence and marriage regulations; and (2) held that the District Court's findings of fact as to the two regulations were not clearly erroneous (777 F2d 1307).",lexis

"In June 1986, the governor of Missouri signed into law a statute which amended existing state law concerning unborn children and abortions. The statute's provisions included (1) a preamble, which set forth the findings of the Missouri legislature that the life of each human being begins at conception and that unborn children have protectable interests in life, health, and well-being, and also mandated that the laws of Missouri were to be interpreted to provide unborn children with all the rights, privileges, and immunities available to other persons, citizens, and residents of Missouri, subject to the Federal Constitution and the precedents of the United States Supreme Court; (2) sections which prohibited the use of public employees and facilities to perform or assist abortions not necessary to save the life of the mother; (3) a section which prohibited the use of public funds for the purpose of ""encouraging or counseling"" a woman to have an abortion not necessary to save her life; and (4) a section which required that, prior to performing an abortion on any woman who a physician has reason to believe is carrying an unborn child of 20 or more weeks' gestational age, the physician--using and exercising the degree of care and skill commonly exercised by the ordinarily prudent and skillful physician engaged in similar practice under similar conditions--ascertain whether the unborn child is viable by performing such medical examinations and tests as are necessary to make a finding of the gestational age, weight, and lung maturity of the unborn child.

"The jury determined that predatory bidding by the competitor was established by evidence that the competitor purchased more logs than it needed, or paid a higher price for logs than necessary, in order to prevent the sawmill from obtaining the logs it needed at a fair price. The competitor argued that a showing of predatory bidding was subject to the same stringent standards applicable to a showing of predatory pricing. The U.S. Supreme Court unanimously held that the theoretical and practical similarities of predatory pricing and predatory bidding warranted application of the previously established predatory pricing test to the sawmill's predatory-bidding claim. Thus, to show predatory bidding, the sawmill was required to show that the competitor's bidding led to below-cost pricing of the competitor's logs, and that the competitor had a dangerous probability of recouping the losses incurred in bidding up log prices through the exercise of monopsony power. Bidding up log prices did not by itself establish predatory bidding since there were myriad legitimate reasons for such bidding, such as increased consumer demand and a hedge against future price increases.",lexis

"A woman who was employed as a senior manager by a nationwide professional accounting firm was proposed for partnership in the firm by the partners in the office where she worked, and the firm, following its usual practice, solicited evaluations of the woman from all of its partners, nearly all of whom were men. In those evaluations, which split sharply on the question whether the woman should be granted or denied partnership, her supporters strongly praised her ability and her record of securing major contracts for the firm, but a number of evaluations sharply criticized her interpersonal skills and specifically accused her of being abrasive. Several of the evaluations on both sides made comments implying that the woman was or had been acting masculine, and one partner, in explaining to the woman the firm's decision to hold her candidacy for reconsideration the following year, suggested that she could improve her chances for partnership by walking, talking, and dressing more femininely. After the partners in her office refused to repropose her for partnership the next year, the woman resigned and brought an action against the firm in the United States District Court for the District of Columbia, which action alleged that the firm had discriminated against her on the basis of sex in violation of Title VII of the Civil Rights Act of 1964 (42 USCS 2000e et seq.), partly on the theory that the evaluations of the woman had been based on sexual stereotyping. The District Court (1) held the firm liable under that theory, as it found that (a) the firm and its partners had not intentionally discriminated on the basis of gender, but (b) the firm had consciously maintained a system which, in this and other partner-candidacy decisions, had given weight to biased criticisms without discouraging sexism or investigating comments to determine whether they were influenced by sexual stereotypes; and (2) ruled that, while the firm could avoid equitable relief such as an order for backpay by proving by clear and convincing evidence that it would have placed the woman's candidacy on hold even absent the discrimination, it had not met that burden of proof; but (3) concluded on other grounds that the woman was not entitled to any relief except (a) attorneys' fees and (b) the difference between her pay and that of a partner from the date she would have been elected partner until her resignation (618 F Supp 1109).

Some of the suburban school districts were permitted to intervene solely to advise the court as to the propriety and form of any metropolitan desegregation plan, and the District Court, in subsequent proceedings, ruled that (1) it could properly consider relief in the form of an inter-district, metropolitan desegregation plan, even though there was no showing that the suburban school districts had committed any constitutional violations, (2) proposed ""Detroit-only"" plans were inadequate, since desegregation limited to the city schools would not produce a racial balance reflecting the racial composition of the metropolitan area as a whole, but would only accentuate the racial identifiability of the city school system as a black system, leaving many of its schools 75 to 90 percent black, (3) to effectively desegregate Detroit schools, it was necessary to look beyond school district lines, which were simply matters of political convenience, and to develop a metropolitan plan with a desegregation area including 53 suburban school districts plus Detroit (a panel being appointed to prepare such a plan), and (4) a specified number of school buses should be obtained to provide transportation under an interim plan to be developed for the coming school year.

The District Court, sitting as a three-judge court, dismissed the action on the ground that it lacked jurisdiction of the subject matter and that the complaint failed to state a claim upon which relief could be granted.

"Illinois law gives every person convicted in a criminal trial a right of review by writ of error; but a full direct appellate review can be had only by furnishing the appellate court with a bill of exceptions or report of the trial proceedings, certified by the trial judge, and it is sometimes impossible to prepare such documents without a stenographic transcript of the trial proceedings, which are furnished free only to indigent defendants sentenced to death. Convicted in an Illinois state court of armed robbery, petitioners moved in the trial court that a certified copy of the entire record, including a stenographic transcript of the proceedings, be furnished to them without cost. They alleged that they were without funds to pay for such documents and that failure of the court to provide them would violate the Due Process and Equal Protection Clauses of the Fourteenth Amendment. Their motion was denied. They then filed a petition under the Illinois Post-Conviction Hearing Act, under which only questions arising under the State or Federal Constitution may be raised. They alleged that there were manifest nonconstitutional errors in the trial which entitled them to have their convictions set aside on appeal, that the only impediment to full appellate review was their lack of funds to buy a transcript, and that refusal to afford full appellate review solely because of their poverty was a denial of due process and equal protection. This petition was dismissed, and the Illinois Supreme Court affirmed, solely on the ground that the petition raised no substantial state or federal constitutional question.",lexis
"The identity of a 17-year-old deceased rape victim was obtained by a television newsman from official court records open to the public. In response to television newscasts in which the victim was identified by name, the father of the victim brought an action against the newsman and the television station in the Superior Court of Fulton County, Georgia, for invasion of privacy, grounding his cause of action on a Georgia criminal statute making it a misdemeanor to publish or broadcast the name or identity of any rape victim. The Superior Court, rejecting the defendants' claims that the broadcasts were privileged under the First and Fourteenth Amendments, held that the Georgia criminal statute gave a civil remedy to those injured by its violation, and granted summary judgment for the father as to liability. On appeal, the Supreme Court of Georgia, although finding that the trial court had erred in construing the criminal statute to extend a civil cause of action for invasion of privacy, held that the complaint stated a cause of action for the invasion of the father's right of privacy under Georgia law apart from the criminal statute. Ruling that liability did not follow as a matter of law and that summary judgment for the father was improper, the Georgia Supreme Court also held, however, that the First and Fourteenth Amendments did not, as a matter of law, require judgment for the defendants. Subsequently denying the defendants' motion for rehearing, the Georgia Supreme Court relied on the criminal statute as an authoritative declaration of state policy that the name of a rape victim was not a matter of public concern which could be published with impunity, and held the statute constitutional as a legitimate limitation on the right of freedom of expression contained in the First Amendment (231 Ga 60, 200 SE2d 127).",lexis

"An Indiana statute made it a misdemeanor to appear in a public place ""in a state of nudity."" Within the statutory definition of ""nudity"" was the showing of (1) the female genitals, pubic area, or buttocks with less than a fully opaque covering, or (2) the female breast with less than a fully opaque covering of any part of the nipple. Two entertainment establishments in South Bend, Indiana wished to provide totally nude dancing as entertainment, although the statute effectively required female dancers to wear at least ""pasties"" and a ""G-string"" while dancing. The two establishments, together with individual dancers employed at those establishments, brought suit in the United States District Court for the Northern District of Indiana against the city of South Bend and various state and local officials to enjoin the enforcement of the statute, on the ground that the statute violated the Federal Constitution's First Amendment. The District Court, granting an injunction, held that the statute was facially overbroad. The United States Court of Appeals for the Seventh Circuit, reversing on appeal, remanded the case to the District Court in order to determine whether the First Amendment was violated by the statute as applied to the type of dancing at issue (802 F2d 287). On remand, the District Court held that such dancing was not protected expressive activity, and accordingly judgment was rendered in favor of the defendants (695 F Supp 414). A panel of the Court of Appeals, reversing on appeal, held that the dancing at issue was expressive conduct protected by the First Amendment (887 F2d 826). On rehearing en banc, the Court of Appeals (1) held that the Indiana statute was an improper infringement of expressive activity, because the statute's purpose was to prevent the message of eroticism and sexuality conveyed by the dancers in question; and (2) enjoined the state from enforcing the statute against the plaintiffs so as to prohibit nonobscene nude dancing as entertainment (904 F2d 1081).",lexis

Further, the subscribers' complaint did not indicate that the carriers' resistance to competitors was anything more than the natural, unilateral reaction of each carrier which was intent on keeping its regional dominance.

"Several black students and their parents brought suit in 1961 in the United States District Court for the Western District of Oklahoma against the board of education of Oklahoma City, and sought to end alleged, de jure segregation of the city's public schools. In 1972, the District Court--having previously determined that the city, in violation of the equal protection clause of the Federal Constitution's Fourteenth Amendment, had intentionally segregated both schools and housing in the past, and had been operating a ""dual,"" racially segregated school system--(1) ruled that previous efforts had not been successful in eliminating such state-imposed segregation; and (2) ordered the adoption of a desegregation plan whose elements included (a) mandatory student assignments for many specified schools and grades, and (b) school busing (338 F Supp 1256). On appeal, the United States Court of Appeals for the Tenth Circuit affirmed (465 F2d 1012), and the United States Supreme Court denied certiorari (409 US 1041, 34 L Ed 2d 490, 93 S Ct 526). In 1977, the District Court, issuing an unpublished, unappealed ""Order Terminating Case,"" expressed the view that (1) the desegregation plan had worked; (2) substantial compliance with the constitutional requirements had been achieved; and (3) a ""unitary"" school system had been accomplished. Later, the board, under allegedly changed conditions, adopted a student reassignment plan to begin in the 1985-1986 school year. Although the reassignment plan continued some busing, the plan also included provisions for (1) some neighborhood assignments, and (2) a student's voluntary transfer from a school in which the student was in the majority to a school in which the student would be in the minority. The black students and their parents then asserted that the school district had not achieved ""unitary"" status and that the reassignment plan was a return to segregation, but the District Court, in refusing to reopen the case, expressed the view that (1) the 1977 finding of unitariness was res judicata as to the parties, and (2) the school district remained unitary (606 F Supp 1548). On appeal, the Court of Appeals, reversing, expressed the view that while the 1977 order was binding on the parties, nothing in the 1977 order indicated that the 1972 injunction itself was terminated (795 F2d 1516). The Supreme Court again denied certiorari (479 US 938, 93 L Ed 2d 370, 107 S Ct 420). On remand, the District Court, in 1987, concluded that the 1972 decree should be vacated and the school district returned to local control, where, according to the District Court, (1) demographic changes had made the desegregation plan unworkable; (2) the board had done nothing for 25 years to promote residential segregation; (3) the school district had bused students for more than a decade in good-faith compliance with the District Court's orders; (4) the city's existing residential segregation was the result of private decisionmaking and economics, rather than a vestige of former school segregation; (5) the district had maintained its unitary status; and (6) the reassignment plan was not designed with discriminatory intent (677 F Supp 1503). On appeal, the Court of Appeals, again reversing, expressed the view that (1) a desegregation decree generally remains in effect until a school district can show a ""grievous wrong"" evoked by new and unforeseen conditions; and (2) the circumstances in the case at hand had not changed enough to justify modification of the 1972 decree, where, according to the Court of Appeals, a number of schools would return to being primarily one-race schools under the reassignment plan (890 F2d 1483).",lexis
"The accused was convicted of second-degree murder by the Court of Common Pleas of Philadelphia County, Pennsylvania, and was sentenced to life imprisonment. The accused's appointed trial attorney appealed the conviction to the Supreme Court of Pennsylvania, which unanimously affirmed the conviction (477 Pa 211, 383 A2d 898). The accused, proceeding pro se, sought postconviction relief under a Pennsylvania statute. The trial court denied relief, but the Supreme Court of Pennsylvania reversed, holding that the accused was entitled, under state law, to appointed counsel in her postconviction proceedings (497 Pa 332, 440 A2d 1183). On remand, the trial court appointed counsel. Appointed counsel reviewed the trial record, consulted with the accused, and after concluding that there were no arguable bases for collateral relief, advised the trial court in writing of such conclusion and requested permission to withdraw. The trial court conducted an independent review of the record, agreed that there were no meritorious issues, and dismissed the petition for postconviction relief. The accused acquired new appointed counsel and appealed to the Superior Court of Pennsylvania. The Superior Court reasoned that Pennsylvania law concerning procedures to be followed in the postconviction proceedings were derived from Anders v California (1967) 386 US 738, 18 L Ed 2d 493, 87 S Ct 1396. Under Anders, when an attorney, appointed to represent an indigent defendant on direct appeal, finds a case wholly frivolous, (1) he or she should (a) request the court's permission to withdraw, (b) submit a brief referring to anything in the record which arguably might support an appeal, and (c) furnish a copy of the brief to the indigent, and (2) after the indigent has had time to raise any points, the court should decide whether the case is wholly frivolous. Thus, the Superior Court (1) held that the first appointed counsel in the postconviction proceedings had failed to follow these procedures, and (2) remanded the case to the Court of Common Pleas for further proceedings (330 Pa Super 313, 479 A2d 468).",lexis
"Under 4044(a) of the Employee Retirement Income Security Act of 1974 (ERISA) (29 USCS 1344(a)), the assets of a single-employer defined benefit plan are to be distributed to participants and beneficiaries upon plan termination in accordance with a six-tier allocation formula, with priority first to nonforfeitable benefits guaranteed by the Pension Benefit Guaranty Corporation (PBGC) ( 4044(a)(1)-(4)), then to ""all other nonforfeitable benefits under the plan"" ( 4044(a)(5)), and finally to ""all other benefits under the plan"" ( 4044(a)(6)). If any funds remain after ""all liabilities to plan participants and beneficiaries have been satisfied,"" they may, pursuant to 4044(d)(1)(A) of ERISA (29 USCS 1344(d)(1)(A)), be recouped by the employer. In 1983, a corporation, which administered and wholly funded a single-employer defined benefit plan for the employees of its wholly owned subsidiary, sold the subsidiary. After obtaining approval of its proposed distribution of plan assets from the PBGC and the Internal Revenue Service (IRS), both of which were responsible for enforcing ERISA, the corporation terminated the plan. The plan provided that (1) participants who completed 10 years of service attained a vested right to accrued benefits, (2) such benefits included normal retirement benefits, payable at age 65 and based upon a participant's earnings and years of service, (3) participants were eligible for early retirement benefits at age 55, calculated in the same manner as normal retirement benefits but reduced by 5 percent for each year by which a participant's retirement preceded the normal retirement age, (4) those participants who had 30 or more years of service and elected to retire after age 62 were eligible for an ""unreduced early retirement benefit,"" which was equal to that payable at age 65, and (5) any surplus remaining in the fund after the satisfaction of all benefit rights or contingent rights accrued under the plan was returnable to the corporation; however, the plan did not provide for any benefits payable solely upon plan termination. Upon termination of the plan, the corporation paid unreduced early retirement benefits only to those employees who had met both the age and years-of-service requirements. As a result, several employees who had met, and one employee who was within 2 years of meeting, the years-of-service requirement but who had not yet reached age 62 received payment equal to the present value of the normal retirement benefit to which they would have been entitled had they retired at age 65, which payment was on average $ 9,000 less than that which the employees would have received had the corporation instead paid them the present value of their unreduced early retirement benefits. When distribution of the plan's assets was complete, nearly $ 11 million remained in the plan's fund, and the corporation recouped the surplus. In 1984, the employees filed suit in the Circuit Court of the City of Radford, Virginia against the corporation, and alleged that the corporation's failure to pay them the present value of unreduced early retirement benefits violated ERISA. The corporation removed the case to the United States District Court for the Western District of Virginia, and moved for summary judgment. The District Court granted the motion, ruling that the employees' early retirement benefits were not ""accrued benefits"" under ERISA. On appeal, the United States Court of Appeals for the Fourth Circuit reversed, holding that the ""benefits under the plan"" required to be allocated under 4044(a)(6) before plan assets could revert to an employer included early retirement benefits, even if such benefits were not accrued at the time of plan termination (815 F2d 989).",lexis
"A criminal defendant was convicted of certain crimes in the Circuit Court of Jackson County, Missouri, despite his contention that his right to trial by a jury chosen from a fair cross section of the community, as guaranteed by the Sixth and Fourteenth Amendments, was denied by provisions of Missouri law granting women an automatic exemption from jury service at their request. In general, the defendant established that while 54% of the adults in the forum county were women, only 26.7% of those summoned from the jury wheel were women, and only 14.5% of the persons on the postsummons weekly venires during the period in which his jury was chosen were female.

"The National Railroad Passenger Corporation, commonly known as Amtrak, was created by the Rail Passenger Service Act of 1970 (RPSA) (45 USCS 501 et seq.) to further a congressional finding that the public convenience and necessity required the continuance and improvement of railroad passenger service. Under the RPSA, as amended, six of Amtrak's eight externally named directors are appointed directly by the President of the United States; four of those directors, including the Secretary of Transportation, are appointed with the advice and consent of the Senate.

The District Court, in granting injunctive relief to the artist, ruled that (1) Amtrak, because of its close ties to the government, was a government actor, at least for purposes of the Federal Constitution's First Amendment; and (2) Amtrak's rejection of the proposed advertisement had violated the First Amendment (811 F Supp 993). The United States Court of Appeals for the Second Circuit, in reversing, (1) said that Amtrak was, by the terms of the RPSA, not a government entity; and (2) concluded that the government was not so involved with Amtrak that Amtrak's decisions could be considered federal action (12 F3d 388).",lexis

Thus, he urged, whatever the constitutional status of peremptory challenges, automatic reversal was the rule as a matter of federal law. However, his argument did not withstand scrutiny. If defendant was tried before a qualified jury composed of individuals not challengeable for cause, the loss of a peremptory challenge due to a state court's good-faith error was not a matter of federal constitutional concern.

After the Circuit Court remanded the case to the Michigan Civil Service Commission for a grievance hearing, the employee filed suit in the Michigan Court of Claims raising an essentially identical 1983 claim, the Civil Service Commission found in the employee's favor, and a state court judge, acting in both the Circuit Court and the Court of Claims cases, held that (1) the employee had established a violation of the Federal Constitution, (2) the State Police and the Director of State Police were persons for purposes of 1983, and (3) although the Circuit Court action was barred under state law, the Court of Claims action could go forward. The Michigan Court of Appeals, holding that a state is not a ""person"" under 1983, vacated the judgment against the Department of State Police and remanded the case for determination of the possible immunity of the Director of State Police from liability for damages.

While the action was pending, an election was held in which black candidates in the areas in question had sharply greater success than in the past; at that point, black candidates had won one of the three positions from District 23, roughly proportional to the black population therein, in six consecutive elections, but in none of the other challenged districts had they had such success in more than three successive elections. A three-judge panel of the District Court (1) ruled that an intervening amendment to 2 had removed any necessity that discriminatory intent be proven, leaving only the necessity to show a vote dilution effect, which could be found in the ""totality of the circumstances"" within which the challenged voting procedure operated; (2) held that such a showing had been made with regard to all of the challenged districts, in view of the court's findings (a) that single-member districts with black majorities could be created in the disputed areas, (b) that historic discrimination in voting and other areas had hindered black voter participation in the state, (c) that other continuing voting procedures also hindered blacks in electing candidates of their choice, (d) that white candidates had encouraged racial bloc voting by appealing to prejudice, (e) that black electoral success had been minimal in relation to the percentage of blacks in the state population, and (f) that statistical evidence showed severe and persistent racially polarized voting in the challenged districts; and (3) enjoined the state from conducting elections pursuant to those portions of the redistricting plan (590 F Supp 345).

The vice-president of the dominant manufacturer, who was also vice-chairman of the subcommittee of the association of mechanical engineers which, among other things, promulgated and published codes and standards for areas of engineering and industry, including the code applicable to cutoffs, and several company officials met with the chairman of that subcommittee. They decided to send an inquiry to the association's committee concerned with boilers asking whether a fuel cutoff with a time delay--which was employed by the new manufacturer, but not employed in the dominant manufacturer's product--satisfied the requirements of the applicable association-promulgated code. The two individuals, as vice-chairman and chairman, respectively, of the relevant subcommittee cooperated in drafting a letter, one they thought would elicit a negative response. Following the association's standard routine, the chairman prepared a response which, in effect, declared the competitor's product unsafe. Salesmen of the dominant manufacturer used the response to discourage customers from buying the competitor's product, so that the manufacturer successfully used his position within the association in an effort to thwart the competitor's challenge. The competitor subsequently sought a correction from the association of the response, but continued to suffer marked resistance after the pertinent committee replied. After the vice-chairman's part in drafting the original letter of inquiry became public, the competitor filed an action in the United States District Court for the Eastern District of New York against the association, and other parties, alleging that their actions had violated 1 and 2 of the Sherman Act (15 USCS 1, 2). After the other parties settled, the lawsuit proceeded to trial against the association, as the remaining defendant. The competitor requested that the trial court instruct the jury that the association could be held liable under the antitrust laws for its agents' conduct if the agents acted within the scope of their apparent authority. The District Court rejected this approach and instead, at the association's suggestion, charged the jury that the association could be held liable only if it had ratified its agents' actions or the agents had acted in pursuit of the association's interests. The jury, nonetheless, returned a verdict for the competitor. The United States Court of Appeals for the Second Circuit concluded that the association could be held liable if its agents had acted within the scope of their apparent authority, and since the District Court had delivered a charge that was more favorable to the defendant than the law requires, affirmed the jury's finding that the association was liable under 1 of the Sherman Act for its agents' actions (635 F2d 118).",lexis

Upon approaching the trucks, the officers smelled the odor of marijuana and observed packages wrapped in dark green plastic in the back of the trucks. After arresting the persons who were at the scene, the packages were removed from the trucks and placed in a warehouse. Three days later, officers conducted a warrantless search of the packages and took samples that later proved to be marijuana. Before trial on federal drug charges, the United States District Court for the District of Arizona granted the defendants' motion to suppress the marijuana. The United States Court of Appeals for the Ninth Circuit affirmed, holding that the rule permitting a warrantless search of containers found in the course of a lawful vehicle search did not authorize a warrantless search of the packages at issue 3 days after their removal from the trucks (707 F2d 1093).",lexis
"Some accused were indicted on federal drug charges when drug evidence was seized after the accused's truck was stopped, on the asserted ground of observed traffic violations, by District of Columbia plainclothes vice squad police officers who were patrolling in an unmarked car in a ""high drug area."" At a pretrial suppression hearing in the United States District Court for the District of Columbia, the accused argued that (1) the stop was not justified by probable cause, or even reasonable suspicion, to believe that the accused had been engaged in illegal drug dealing, and (2) the asserted traffic-violation motive for the stop was pretextual. The District Court, in denying the accused's motion to suppress the drug evidence, (1) found that the officers had probable cause to believe that the accused had violated the traffic code, and (2) expressed the view that there was nothing to demonstrate that the officers' actions were contrary to a normal traffic stop. The accused were then convicted on the pertinent drug charges. On appeal, the United States Court of Appeals for the District of Columbia Circuit, in affirming in pertinent part, expressed the view that with respect to the suppression issue, a traffic stop was permissible--regardless of whether a police officer subjectively believed that the occupants of an automobile might be engaging in some other illegal behavior--as long as a reasonable officer in the same circumstances ""could have"" stopped the car for the suspected traffic violation (53 F3d 371).",lexis

The plan was based on a ""political fairness"" principle which was designed to reflect the relative strength of the major political parties by creating a certain number of ""safe"" districts for each party and a certain number of ""swing"" districts. The plan was challenged in the United States District Court for the District of Connecticut. A three-judge District Court was convened and held (1) that the population variations among the districts were not justified by any sufficient state interest and violated the equal protection clause, and (2) that the policy of partisan political structuring was not a legitimate reason for violating the requirement of numerical equality in districting (341 F Supp 139).",lexis

"Teachers and administrators in an Oregon public school district observed a sharp increase in student drug use and disciplinary problems. Because drug use increases the risk of sports-related injuries, the school district was particularly concerned with the fact that student athletes were leaders of the drug culture. After a parent ""input night"" at which the parents in attendance gave their unanimous approval to a proposed urinalysis drug testing policy for student athletes, the district's school board implemented the policy, under which (1) all students wishing to participate in interscholastic athletics had to sign a form consenting to the testing and had to obtain their parents' written consent to the testing, (2) athletes were tested at the beginning of the season for their sport, and (3) random testing of 10 percent of the athletes was done weekly during the season. A seventh grade student was denied participation in the district's football program because the student and his parents refused to sign the testing consent forms. The student and his parents filed a suit seeking declaratory and injunctive relief from enforcement of the drug testing policy on the grounds that the policy violated the Federal Constitution's Fourth Amendment and a provision of the Oregon Constitution. After the United States District Court for the District of Oregon dismissed the suit (796 F Supp 1354), the United States Court of Appeals for the Ninth Circuit, expressing the view that the policy violated the Fourth Amendment and the Oregon constitutional provision, reversed the District Court's judgment (23 F3d 1514).",lexis

The commission issued the license over objections by the Tuscarora Indian Nation based on the ground, among others, that the portion of its land sought to be taken was part of a ""reservation,"" as defined in 3(2), and as used in 4(e), of the Federal Power Act, and therefore could not lawfully be taken for reservoir purposes in the absence of a finding by the commission that the license would not interfere or be inconsistent with the purpose for which such reservation was created or acquired. The Court of Appeals for the District of Columbia Circuit held that the Tuscarora lands sought to be taken for the reservoir constituted a part of such a ""reservation"" and remanded the case to the commission that it might explore the possibility of making the finding required in such a case by the provisions of the act.

"California amended its alcoholic beverage control laws to prohibit a licensed importer from purchasing or accepting delivery of any brand of distilled spirits unless he is designated as an authorized importer of such brand by the brand owner or his authorized agent. It apparently enacted this ""designation statute"" in response to the effects of Oklahoma's alcoholic beverage laws which were understood to require any distiller or brand owner selling its products to Oklahoma wholesalers to sell to all wholesalers on a nondiscriminatory basis. Because of the perceived extraterritorial effect of Oklahoma's ""open-wholesaling"" statutes, a licensed California importer who was unable to obtain distilled spirits through the distiller's established distribution system could obtain them from Oklahoma wholesalers. As a result, a distiller who desired to sell its products to Oklahoma wholesalers was unable to rely on contractual undertakings to determine which California wholesalers would handle its products. California's designation statute, therefore, sought to close off the ""Oklahoma connection"" to California importers not authorized by the distiller to deal in its products. Prior to the effective date of the designation statute, liquor importers who were benefiting from the Oklahoma connection, brought suit in the Court of Appeal of California, Third District, to enjoin enforcement of the designation statute. The Court of Appeal agreed with the importers that the designation statute on its face conflicted with 1 of the Sherman Act (15 USCS 1) and concluded that the designation statute was preempted by the Sherman Act (108 Cal App 3d 348, 166 Cal Rptr 563).

"Under a California statute, bingo games are not entirely prohibited, but are permitted where (1) the games are operated and staffed by members of designated charitable organizations who are not paid for their services, (2) profits are kept in special accounts and used for charitable purposes, and (3) prizes do not exceed $ 250 per game. Violation of any of these provisions is a misdemeanor. The Cabazon and Morongo Bands of Mission Indians, two federally recognized Indian tribes, occupy reservations in Riverside County, California. As a major source of tribal employment, and the sole source of tribal income, (1) both tribes conducted federally approved bingo games in a manner which was not completely in accordance with the state statute, and (2) the Cabazon Band operated a club where card games were played. The state insisted that the tribes' bingo games comply with the state statute, and the county also sought to apply its local ordinances on bingo and card games. The tribes sued the county in Federal District Court, the state intervened, and the District Court (1) granted summary judgment in favor of the tribes on the jurisdictional question whether the state and county gambling laws applied on the two reservations, (2) permanently restrained the state and county from applying their gambling laws on the reservations, and (3) retained jurisdiction to consider the issue of damages. On appeal, the United States Court of Appeals for the Ninth Circuit affirmed the summary judgment and permanent injunction of the District Court, and expressed the view that the state and local laws pertaining to gambling did not apply to the reservations under either (1) Public Law 280 (18 USCS 1162, 28 USCS 1360), which grants criminal and civil jurisdiction to California over the Indian reservations in certain situations; (2) the Organized Crime Control Act (OCCA) (18 USCS 1955), which incorporates by reference certain state gambling laws and makes violation of the state laws a federal offense; or (3) federal common law (783 F2d 900).",lexis

The amended complaint alleged that the college and its tenure committee violated 42 USCS 1981, which provides that all persons within the jurisdiction of the United States shall have the same right to make and enforce contracts as is enjoyed by white citizens. The District Court (1) applied a 6-year Pennsylvania statute of limitations to the 1981 claim and held that the claim was not time-barred, and (2) ruled that an action under 1981 could be maintained, since the complaint alleged denial of tenure because the professor was of the Arabian race (523 F Supp 386). Another judge of the District Court, construing the complaint as asserting discrimination on the basis of only national origin and religion, granted summary judgment for the college. On appeal, the United States Court of Appeals for the Third Circuit reversed and remanded, holding that (1) a Third Circuit decision, decided after the professor had filed his suit, holding that 1981 cases were to be governed by Pennsylvania's 2-year statute of limitations for personal injury tort actions, should not be applied retroactively to bar the suit, (2) the professor had alleged discrimination based on race and, although under current racial classifications Arabs are Caucasians, the professor could maintain his 1981 claim, and (3) the professor would be given the opportunity on remand, to prove that he had been subjected to the sort of prejudice that 1981 would redress as being impermissibly racially based (784 F2d 505).",lexis

The manufacturer of a type of pistol, and of a kit that could be used to convert such pistols within a few minutes into rifles with either a 21-inch barrel or a 10-inch barrel, was advised by the Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco, and Firearms that, when the conversion kit was possessed or distributed with the pistol, the unit consisting of the pistol and the kit constituted a firearm subject to the NFA.

"An individual who was a diabetic felt the onset of an insulin reaction and desired to purchase some orange juice to counteract the reaction. A friend drove the individual to a convenience store, but the individual, upon entering the store and seeing a number of people ahead of him at the checkout line, hurried out of the store and returned to the friend's automobile, whereupon the individual requested that the friend drive him to another friend's house. A municipal law enforcement officer, who had seen the individual's hasty entrance into and exit from the store, made an investigative stop of the automobile about 1/2 mile from the store and was informed by the friend that the individual was suffering from a ""sugar reaction."" The officer nevertheless ordered the friend and the individual to wait until the officer could determine what, if anything, happened at the convenience store, and then called for backup assistance. When the backup officers arrived, the individual, who had meanwhile left the automobile, was tightly handcuffed, shoved face-first against the hood of the friend's automobile, and then thrown head-first into a police car. Finally, the officer who had stopped the automobile received a report that the individual had done nothing wrong at the store, whereupon the individual was driven home and released. The individual, who had sustained multiple injuries during the incident, thereafter filed an action in the United States District Court for the Western District of North Carolina against the officers involved, alleging that the officers had used excessive force in making the investigatory stop in violation of rights secured to him under the Federal Constitution's Fourteenth Amendment and 42 USCS 1983. During the ensuing jury trial, the officers moved for a directed verdict at the close of the individual's evidence. The District Court granted the officers' motion, finding that the officers' excessive use of force did not give rise to a cause of action under 1983, since the amount of force used (1) was appropriate under the circumstances, (2) did not inflict any discernable injury, and (3) was not applied maliciously or sadistically for the very purpose of causing harm, but in a good-faith effort to maintain or restore order in the face of a potentially explosive situation (644 F Supp 246). On appeal by the individual, the United States Court of Appeals for the Fourth Circuit affirmed, ruling that the District Court had applied the correct legal standard in assessing the individual's excessive force claim (827 F2d 945).",lexis
"A white male who had been denied admission to the medical school at the University of California at Davis for two consecutive years, instituted an action for declaratory and injunctive relief against the Regents of the University in the Superior Court of Yolo County, California, alleging the invalidity--under the equal protection clause of the Fourteenth Amendment, a provision of the California Constitution, and the proscription in Title VI of the Civil Rights Act of 1964 (42 USCS 2000d et seq.) against racial discrimination in any program receiving federal financial assistance--of the medical school's special admissions program under which only disadvantaged members of certain minority races were considered for 16 of the 100 places in each year's class, whereas members of any race could qualify under the school's general admissions program for the other 84 places in the class, the plaintiff having been denied admission to the school under the general admissions program even though applicants with substantially lower entrance examination scores had been admitted under the special admissions program. Finding that the special admissions program operated as a racial quota because minority applicants in the special program were rated only against one another and 16 places in the class of 100 were reserved for them, the trial court (1) declared that the school could not take race into account in making admissions decisions, (2) held that the challenged admissions program violated the federal and state constitutions and Title VI, but (3) refused to order the plaintiff's admission because he had failed to prove that he would have been admitted but for the existence of the special program. On direct appeal, the Supreme Court of California affirmed the trial court's judgment insofar as it determined that the special admissions program was invalid under the equal protection clause, but reversed it insofar as it denied an injunction ordering that the plaintiff be admitted to the medical school, the California Supreme Court having ruled that the University had the burden of demonstrating that the plaintiff would not have been admitted even in the absence of the special admissions program, and the University having conceded its inability to carry that burden (18 Cal 3d 34, 553 P2d 1152).",lexis

This document, popularly known as the ""Pentagon Papers,"" bore a Defense Department security classification of ""Top Secret--Sensitive."" The Senator then placed all 47 volumes of the study in the public record. Subsequently, a federal grand jury, convened for the purpose of investigating possible criminal conduct with respect to the release and publication of these classified documents, subpoenaed as a witness an aide to the Senator, who had been added to the Senator's staff on the same day the Senator had introduced the documents into the public record. The Senator, as intervenor, filed motions to quash the subpoena and to specify the exact nature of the questions to be asked his aide, on the ground that requiring the aide to appear and testify would violate his privilege under the speech or debate clause of Article I, 6, of the United States Constitution. The Senator filed the same motions and made the same contentions as to a subpoena issued to the editor of a private book-publishing firm with which the Senator had arranged for the Pentagon Papers to be republished. The United States District Court for the District of Massachusetts overruled the Senator's motions, but did enter an order proscribing certain categories of questions (332 F Supp 930). The United States Court of Appeals for the First Circuit affirmed the denial of the motions, but modified the District Court's protective order, holding that neither the Senator nor his aide could be questioned about the Senator's legislative acts or duties, that the Senator and his aide were protected from questions about the republication of the Pentagon Papers because of a common-law privilege akin to the judicially created immunity of executive officers from liability for libel, and that persons, other than the Senator and his aide, could be questioned by the grand jury with regard to the republication details (445 F2d 753).",lexis

The distributor then brought an action against the Commission in the United States District Court for the District of South Dakota, challenging the policy of preferring South Dakota buyers and seeking injunction relief.

A federal grand jury indicted the operator for importing and conspiring to import the fish in violation of 3(a)(2)(A) of the Lacey Act Amendments of 1981 (16 USCS 3372(a)(2)(A)), which makes it a federal crime to import fish or wildlife in violation of state law. The operator moved to dismiss the indictment on the ground that the state statute violated the commerce clause of the Federal Constitution (Art I, 8, cl 3); but a federal magistrate, after conducting an evidentiary hearing, recommended that the motion be denied, finding (1) that the state statute had a legitimate and substantial purpose in preventing the accidental introduction of baitfish parasites or of nonnative fish species, which would have unpredictable effects on native fish populations, and (2) that there were no less discriminatory means of protecting against these threats, as adequate inspection methods were not currently available. Agreeing with those findings, the United States District Court for the District of Maine denied the motion to dismiss (585 F Supp 393). The operator then entered a conditional guilty plea, reserving the right to appeal the District Court's constitutional holding.

"From 1981 to 1983, a husband and wife were the southwestern United States distributors of products made with sorbothane, a patented elastic polymer, under a regional distributorship arrangement with the manufacturer of the products. The manufacturer gradually shifted away from the southwestern distributors the right to distribute various types of sorbothane products, and ultimately the manufacturer informed the southwestern distributers that their sorbothane orders would no longer be accepted. The national distributorship of one type of sorbothane product was thereupon transferred to a company that was co-owned by the son of the manufacturer's president. The southwestern distributers' business failed, and they filed suit in Federal District Court against the son's company and others for alleged violations of, among other things, 2 of the Sherman Act (15 USCS 2), which makes it a felony for a person to monopolize, or attempt to monopolize, or combine or conspire to monopolize any part of interstate commerce. The District Court's jury instructions stated that if it were shown that the defendants had engaged in predatory conduct, the jury would be permitted to infer two of the elements of attempted monopolization--specific intent and dangerous probability of success--from such conduct, without any proof of the relevant market or of the defendants' market power. The jury returned a verdict in which the defendants were found to have violated 2 by ""monopolizing, attempting to monopolize, and/or conspiring to monopolize."" The United States Court of Appeals for the Ninth Circuit, affirming on appeal, eld that (1) the verdict would stand if the evidence supported any one of the three possible violations of 2; and (2) a case of attempted monopolization had been established, in that (a) there was sufficient evidence from which the jury could conclude that the defendants had engaged in unfair or predatory conduct, (b) based on such evidence, the jury properly inferred specific intent and the dangerous probability of success, and (c) it was therefore not necessary to provide proof of the relevant market or of the defendants' market power.",lexis

The Supreme Court held that the distinction between collateral and direct consequences was ill-suited to the deportation context, so advice regarding deportation was not categorically removed from the ambit of the Sixth Amendment. Counsel's alleged failure to correctly advise defendant of the deportation consequences of his guilty plea amounted to constitutionally deficient assistance under prevailing professional norms, as the consequences could easily have been determined from reading the removal statute.

A rule of one of the exchanges provided for the arbitration of any controversy between a registered representative and a member organization arising out of the representative's termination of employment.

The four men, one of whom was the petitioner, were arrested, and the car was taken to the police station. The police conducted a warrantless search of the car at the station and found two revolvers, ammunition, and property stolen in the robberies. The police also searched the petitioner's home and found more ammunition of the same type as that found in the car.

A United States Coast Guard officer--a helicopter pilot--was dispatched on a rescue mission. After the officer requested radar assistance from civilian air traffic controllers of the Federal Aviation Administration, and the controllers assumed radar control of the officer's helicopter, the helicopter crashed into a mountain in Hawaii, killing the officer and the rest of the crew. The officer's widow filed a wrongful death action under the FTCA in the United States District Court for the Southern District of Florida, and alleged that the controllers' negligence caused her husband's death. The District Court, however, relying on the Feres doctrine, dismissed the action, on the ground that the officer had been killed in the course of his military duties.

On rehearing, an en banc opinion of the Court of Appeals eventually agreed with the panel, and, reinstating the panel opinion, expressed the view that the panel opinion had given proper consideration to the Feres factors, with particular attention to whether the claims asserted in the case would implicate civilian courts in conflicts involving the military structure or military decisions (779 F2d 1492).",lexis

"A resident of Wisconsin, who was employed in and commuted to Minnesota, died of injuries suffered when a motorcycle on which he was a passenger was struck from behind by an automobile. The accident occurred in Wisconsin, immediately across the Minnesota border. The operators of both vehicles were Wisconsin residents, and neither of them carried valid insurance.

"Under Ohio law, (1) a 10-acre state-owned square surrounding the statehouse in the city of Columbus was available for discussion of public questions and for public activities, (2) an advisory board was responsible for regulating public access to the square, and (3) to use the square, a group simply had to submit an application to the board and meet several criteria that were neutral as to the speech content of the proposed use. The board, after reversing an initial decision to ban holiday displays from the square during December 1993, authorized the state to put up its annual Christmas tree and granted a rabbi's application to erect a menorah. However, the board denied an Ohio Ku Klux Klan officer's application for a permit to place a cross on the square from December 8 to December 24. After unsuccessfully seeking administrative relief from the board's decision, the Ohio Klan, through its leader, filed in the United States District Court for the Southern District of Ohio a suit seeking an injunction requiring the board to issue the requested permit. The board defended on the ground that the permit would violate the establishment of religion clause of the Federal Constitution's First Amendment. The District Court, expressing the view that the board had failed to show that the display of the cross reasonably could be construed as state endorsement of Christianity, issued the injunction (844 F Supp 1182), and after the board's application for an emergency stay was denied by a United States Supreme Court Justice (510 US ____, 126 L Ed 2d 636, 114 S Ct 626), the board permitted the Klan to erect the cross. The United States Court of Appeals for the Sixth Circuit affirmed the District Court's judgment (30 F3d 675).",lexis
"The governor of Kentucky gave the chairman of the state Democratic Party de facto control over the selection of insurance agencies from which the state would purchase its policies. The chairman made an agreement with a designated agency under which that agency would continue to secure a workers' compensation policy for the state if that agency would share resulting commissions with other specified agencies. Pursuant to this agreement, the agency paid some $ 200,000 to a company which was established and controlled by the chairman and another state official, but which was nominally owned and operated by a third party who was also active in the state Democratic party. Based on the mailing of a commission check to the designated agency by an insurer, a charge was brought against the chairman in United States District Court for violating the federal mail fraud statute (18 USCS 1341), which prohibits the use of the mails to execute ""any scheme or artifice to defraud, or for obtaining money or property by means of false or fraudulent pretenses, representations, or promises."" The chairman was alleged to have violated 1341 by (1) defrauding the citizens and government of Kentucky of their right to have the state's affairs conducted honestly, and (2) obtaining money by means of false pretenses and concealment of material facts. The District Court instructed the jury that a violation of 1341 could be made out by a finding that the chairman directed payments to an agency in which he had an ownership interest without disclosing that interest to other persons in the state government whose actions could have been affected by the disclosure. The chairman was convicted of mail fraud, and the United States Court of Appeals for the Sixth Circuit affirmed, holding that the chairman was a public fiduciary and that 1341 proscribes schemes to defraud citizens of their intangible rights to honest and impartial government (790 F2d 1290).",lexis

Thereafter, the applicant, who would have been unable to satisfy either of the statutory prerequisites for a court order granting permission to marry, brought a civil rights class action in the United States District Court for the Eastern District of Wisconsin, asserting that the Wisconsin statute violated the United States Constitution.

In a suit by the same patent assignee alleging infringement of the same patent by a different defendant, the United States District Court for the Northern District of Illinois, relying upon the United States Supreme Court's decision in Triplett v Lowell, 297 US 638, 80 L Ed 949, 56 S Ct 645, concluded that it was not bound by the prior determination of the patent's invalidity, and the District Court proceeded to hold that the antenna was nonobvious and that the patent was valid and had been infringed by the defendant. The Court of Appeals for the Seventh Circuit, also relying on Triplett v Lowell, held that the prior determination of the patent's invalidity was not binding, and the Court of Appeals affirmed the District Court's holdings that the patent was valid and had been infringed by the defendant (422 F2d 769).",lexis

Subsequently, the court dismissed his petition for habeas corpus and the Supreme Court of Illinois affirmed, rejecting his contention that the disqualification for cause of jurors having scruples against capital punishment violated his right to a trial by jury and subjected him to trial by a jury which favored the prosecution in deciding the issue of guilt or innocence.

"A defendant who had been imprisoned twice following felony convictions in Texas state courts, once for fraudulent use of a credit card to obtain $ 80 worth of goods or services, and then for passing a forged check in the amount of $ 28.36, subsequently was charged with ""felony theft"" for obtaining $ 120.75 by false pretenses. The prosecution chose to proceed against the defendant under Texas' recidivist statute, mandating life imprisonment for anyone upon his third conviction of a felony less than capital. Following the defendant's conviction on the felony theft charge, the Texas trial court imposed a life sentence on the defendant under the recidivist statute. The defendant pursued an unsuccessful direct appeal and collateral attacks on his imprisonment in the Texas appellate courts, and then sought habeas corpus relief in the United States District Court for the Western District of Texas, claiming, among other things, that his life sentence was so disproportionate to the crimes he had committed as to constitute cruel and unusual punishment under the Eighth and Fourteenth Amendments. The District Court rejected the cruel and unusual punishment claim and denied habeas corpus relief. A panel of the United States Court of Appeals for the Fifth Circuit reversed, holding that the life sentence was so grossly disproportionate to the defendant's offenses as to constitute cruel and unusual punishment (568 F2d 1193), but on rehearing by the Court of Appeals sitting en banc, the panel's opinion was vacated and the District Court's denial of habeas corpus relief was affirmed (587 F2d 651).",lexis

The bank filed a proof of claim with the Bankruptcy Court for $ 71,335 in principal, interest, and fees owed on the note which the mortgage secured. Relying on 506(a) of the Bankruptcy Code (11 USCS 506(a))--which provides that an allowed claim secured by a lien on the debtor's property is a secured claim to the extent of the value of the creditor's interest in the property and is an unsecured claim to the extent the claim exceeds the value of the creditor's interest in the property--the debtors (1) valued the residence at $ 23,500 in their Chapter 13 plan and proposed to make payments pursuant to the mortgage contract up to only that amount plus prepetition arrearages; and (2) proposed to treat the remainder of the bank's claim as unsecured. Under the debtors' proposed plan, unsecured creditors were to receive nothing. The bank and the Chapter 13 trustee, objecting to the plan, argued that the debtors' proposed bifurcation of the bank's claim into a secured claim for $ 23,500 and an effectively worthless unsecured claim modified the bank's rights as a homestead mortgagee in violation of 11 USCS 1322(b)(2), which provides that a Chapter 13 plan may ""modify the rights of holders of secured claims, other than a claim secured only by a security interest in real property that is the debtor's principal residence."" Agreeing with the bank and the trustee, the Bankruptcy Court denied confirmation of the debtors' Chapter 13 plan.

"The first count of a criminal complaint charged a motorist with violation of the California Vehicle Code's provision against passing another vehicle without maintaining a safe distance, and the second count of the complaint charged him with failing to comply with the provisions of the ""hit and run"" statute, requiring the driver of a motor vehicle involved in an accident resulting in damage to any property to stop at the scene and give his name and address. Both charges arose out of the same accident, and the defendant's demurrer to the second count, asserting violation of his privilege against self-incrimination, was overruled by a California Justice Court. The defendant then sought a writ of prohibition from the Superior Court of Mendocino County, California, to restrain prosecution of the second count. The Superior Court issued the writ, and the Supreme Court of California ultimately affirmed, holding that the privilege against self- incrimination was applicable to a motorist, such as the defendant, who reasonably believed that compliance with the statute would result in a substantial risk of self-incrimination. The California Supreme Court also held that in the case of such a motorist, the hit-and-run statute should be limited by a restriction preventing use in subsequent criminal prosecutions, arising from the motorist's conduct, of information disclosed under the statute, and the fruits of such information, but the court concluded that it would be unfair to punish the defendant for failure to comply with the statute, since he could have had no knowledge that use restrictions would be imposed by the courts (71 Cal 2d 1039, 80 Cal Rptr 553, 458 P2d 465).",lexis

Two weeks before the election, the association sought and obtained from the Superior Court, Alameda County, a temporary restraining order prohibiting enforcement of the ordinance. Following the ballot measure's defeat, the Superior Court granted the association's motion for summary judgment, declaring that the ordinance was invalid on its face because it violated the state constitution and the First Amendment of the Federal Constitution, and the California Court of Appeal, First District, affirmed that conclusion (160 Cal Rptr 448). The Supreme Court of California reversed, concluding that the ordinance furthered compelling governmental interests because it ensured that special interest groups could not corrupt the initiative process by spending large amounts to support or oppose a ballot measure and that the ordinance accomplished its goal by the least restrictive means available (27 Cal3d 819, 614 P2d 742, 167 Cal Rptr 84).",lexis

"In a Florida state court, the accused was convicted of murder and sentenced to death. There was no suggestion that he was incompetent at the time of his offense, at trial, or at sentencing. Later, however, he began to manifest changes in behavior, indicating a mental disorder. At his attorneys' request, two psychiatrists examined him, one of whom concluded that he was not competent to suffer execution. His counsel then invoked the procedures of Florida law governing the determination of the competency of a condemned inmate. Following such procedures, the Governor of Florida appointed a panel of three psychiatrists to evaluate whether the accused had the mental capacity to understand the nature of the death penalty and the reasons why it was imposed on him. The Governor specifically directed that during the evaluation, the accused's and the state's attorneys should not participate in any adversarial manner. The members of the panel together interviewed the accused for about 30 minutes, and while they differed on their diagnoses, they agreed that the accused understood his situation and the nature of the death penalty. The accused's attorneys then tried unsuccessfully to submit to the Governor some other materials, including the reports of the psychiatrists who had examined the accused at his counsel's request. The Governor announced his decision when, without any explanation or statement, he signed a death warrant for the accused's execution. The accused's attorneys, after unsuccessfully seeking a hearing in state court to determine his competency to suffer execution (451 So 2d 471), filed a petition for habeas corpus in the United States District Court for the Southern District of Florida, seeking an evidentiary hearing on the question of his sanity, and proferring the conflicting findings of the Governor-appointed panel and subsequent challenges to their methods by other psychiatrists.

"MuAn Arizona criminal defendant was charged with first-degree murder, based in part on evidence that (1) he had been found driving the victim's car and using the victim's credit cards, and (2) other items belonging to the victim had been found in a rental car abandoned by the defendant. After the defendant's initial conviction was set aside by the Supreme Court of Arizona (142 Ariz 619, 691 P2d 710), the defendant was retried on theories of both premeditated murder and felony-murder, either of which, under the trial court's instructions to the jury, would constitute first-degree murder. The defense, contending that the circumstantial evidence proved at most that the defendant was a thief, requested an instruction on theft as a lesser included offense. The trial court refused this request, but did instruct the jury on second-degree murder, and further advised them that all 12 jurors had to agree on a verdict. The defendant was then convicted of first-degree murder and sentenced to death. In affirming the defendant's conviction and sentence against various challenges, the Supreme Court of Arizona held that the trial court (1) had not erred in failing to require the jury to agree on a single theory of first-degree murder, since first-degree murder is one offense under state law regardless of whether it occurs as premeditated murder or felony-murder, and (2) had not committed plain error in failing to instruct the jury on the lesser included offense of robbery (168 Ariz 411, 788 P2d 1162).",lexis
"The plaintiffs' spouses, a Navy flight instructor and her student, were killed during training exercises when their Navy airplane, banking sharply to avoid another airplane, crashed and burned. At the trial of the plaintiffs' product liability suit against the companies that had manufactured and serviced the decedents' airplane, the only seriously disputed question was whether pilot error or equipment malfunction had caused the crash. Having initially determined that an investigative report prepared pursuant to authority granted in the Manual of the Judge Advocate General (the JAG Report) was sufficiently trustworthy to be admissible, the trial judge admitted, over the plaintiffs' objection, most of the JAG Report's ""opinions,"" including a paragraph opining that pilot error was the most probable cause of the crash. One of the plaintiffs, who was himself a Navy flight instructor, had, some 6 months after the crash, written a detailed letter based on his own investigation in which he took issue with some of the JAG Report's findings and outlined his theory that equipment malfunction had been the most probable primary cause of the crash. At trial, after that plaintiff admitted on direct examination as an adverse witness that he had made certain statements in his letter arguably implicating pilot error as the cause of the crash, his counsel attempted to ask him on cross-examination whether he had not also said in the letter that the most probable primary cause of the crash had been loss of engine power. However, before the plaintiff answered, the court sustained a defense objection on the ground that the question asked for the plaintiff's opinion; further questioning along this line was cut off. After the jury returned a verdict for the defendants, a panel of the United States Court of Appeals for the Eleventh Circuit reversed and remanded for a new trial (784 F2d 1523). Accepting the argument that Rule 803(8)(C) of the Federal Rules of Evidence, which excepts investigatory reports from the hearsay rule, did not encompass evaluative conclusions or opinions, the Court of Appeals held that the ""conclusions"" contained in the JAG Report should have been excluded. Citing Rules 106 (partially codifying the common-law rule of completeness) and 801(d)(1)(B) (relating to the nonhearsay status of prior consistent statements) of the Federal Rules of Evidence, the Court of Appeals also held that it had been reversible error for the trial court to have prohibited cross-examination regarding additional portions of the plaintiff's letter that would have put in context the admissions elicited from him on direct examination.

Chilean courts had granted the mother daily care and control of the child and had awarded visitation rights to the father.

The court of appeals held that the ne exeat right was not a ""right of custody"" under the Convention and that the Convention's return remedy was therefore not authorized. The Supreme Court disagreed, holding that the father's joint right to decide the child's country of residence was a right of custody within the meaning of Convention art. 5(a). The father's ne exeat right gave him the right to determine the child's place of residence by ensuring that the child could not live outside Chile and also gave the father rights relating to the care of the person of the child.

The Act authorizes the Secretary of Health and Human Services to make grants to, and enter into contracts with, public or nonprofit private entities to assist in family planning projects. Under 1008 of the Act (42 USCS 300a-6), it is provided that ""[n]one of the funds appropriated under this subchapter shall be used in programs where abortion is a method of family planning."" In 1988, the Secretary promulgated new regulations ( 42 CFR 59.2, 59.8, 59.9, and 59.10), which specified that projects receiving Title X funds (1) may not provide counseling concerning the use of abortion, or referral for abortion, as a method of family planning; (2) may not engage in activities that encourage, promote, or advocate abortion as a method of family planning; and (3) must be organized so that they are physically and financially separate from prohibited abortion activities.

The men said they did not, but they consented to a search of the car. A second officer, conducting the search without having obtained a warrant, discovered cocaine inside an interior panel. The men were arrested on drug charges. In pretrial motions to suppress the cocaine evidence, it was alleged that the officers had violated the men's rights under the Federal Constitution's Fourth Amendment by detaining the men in the parking lot and by searching inside the panel without a warrant. A United States Magistrate Judge concluded that the circumstances had given the officers reasonable suspicion to stop and question the men, but not probable cause to conduct a warrantless search. The United States District Court for the Eastern District of Wisconsin--adopting the Magistrate Judge's recommendation with respect to reasonable suspicion, but not the reasoning as to probable cause--ruled that the cocaine need not be excluded, and the men were convicted.

"A criminal defendant was found by a Louisiana trial court to have been insane at the time of the offense, and accordingly the court ruled that he was not guilty by reason of insanity. The person was committed to a psychiatric facility until such time as doctors recommended that he be released, and until further order of the court. When the superintendent of the facility and a three-member panel at the facility recommended that the person be conditionally discharged, the trial judge appointed a commission of two doctors, who reported that the person was in remission from mental illness, but that he had an antisocial personality, and that this condition was not a mental disease but was untreatable. One of the doctors testified that the person had been involved in several altercations at the facility and that the doctor would not feel comfortable in certifying that the person would not be a danger to himself or to other people. After it was stipulated that the other doctor would have given essentially the same testimony, the court ruled that the person was dangerous to himself and to others and ordered him returned to the facility. The Court of Appeals of Louisiana refused supervisory writs. The Supreme Court of Louisiana, affirming, held that (1) neither the due process clause nor the equal protection clause of the Federal Constitution's Fourteenth Amendment was violated by a Louisiana statutory provision under which an insanity acquittee who has been committed to a mental hospital, but whose release from the hospital has been recommended by a hospital review panel, may be returned to the hospital after a court hearing, regardless of whether the acquittee is then mentally ill, if the acquittee fails to prove that the acquittee is not dangerous; and (2) the person had not carried the burden of proving that he was not dangerous (563 So 2d 1138).",lexis
"Contrary to the employees' argument, 28 U.S.C.S. ¬¨√ü 1453(c) did not deprive the U.S. Supreme Court of jurisdiction to review a case. ""Principal place of business"" under ¬¨√ü 1332(c)(1) referred to where a corporation's officers directed, controlled, and coordinated the corporation's activities, a ""nerve center."" It would normally be a corporation's headquarters--provided it was not simply an office for board meetings. The ""nerve center"" was a single place. A more general business activities test led to incorrectly measuring the amount of business activities in a state. The simple ""nerve center"" jurisdictional rule promoted predictability. The ""nerve center"" approach was simple to apply, comparatively speaking. Section 1332(c)(1)'s legislative history suggested ""principal place of business"" was not to be interpreted to be complex. The employer's unchallenged declaration suggested its center of direction, control, and coordination, its ""nerve center,"" and its corporate headquarters, were one and the same, located in New Jersey. But, the employees would have a fair opportunity to litigate that issue on remand.  [***1030]",lexis
"In 1977, the Kansas City, Missouri, School District, the school board, and the children of two school board members brought suit in the United States District Court for the Western District of Missouri against the state of Missouri, various suburban school districts, and other defendants for allegedly causing and perpetuating racial segregation in the schools of the city's metropolitan area. The District Court, having dismissed the case against the suburban school districts and realigned the city district as a nominal defendant, determined that the state and the city district had operated a segregated school system within the city district (593 F Supp 1485). In 1985, the District Court (1) determined that segregation had caused a systemwide reduction in student achievement in the city district's schools; (2) identified 25 schools within the city district that had enrollments of 90 percent or more black students; and (3) ordered a wide range of remedial ""quality education"" programs for all students in the city district's schools (639 F Supp 19). In 1986, the District Court adopted a comprehensive magnet school program in order to draw nonminority students from private schools and the suburban districts into city district schools. In 1987 and subsequently, the District Court ordered salary assistance that was eventually extended to virtually all of the city district's instructional and noninstructional employees. The costs of these and other desegregation programs ordered by the District Court for the city district ultimately approached an annual cost of $ 200 million. The District Court's authority to order the city district to levy taxes to fund the desegregation programs was ultimately upheld in 1990 by the United States Supreme Court (495 US 33, 109 L Ed 2d 31, 110 S Ct 1651), but a major share of the programs' costs was paid by the state. In 1992, the District Court ordered the state to continue to fund the quality education programs, on the ground that student achievement levels were still at or below national norms at many grade levels. In 1993, the District Court--noting that its salary ruling was grounded in remedying the vestiges of segregation by improving the city district's desegregative attractiveness--entered orders requiring the state to pay for across-the-board salary increases and to continue funding the quality education programs.

"An alien entered the United States illegally and was taken by smugglers to a house in Escondido, California. Six days later, in exchange for his not having to pay the smugglers for bringing him across the border, the alien agreed to drive himself and five other passengers to Los Angeles. During the course of this drive, the alien and three of his passengers were apprehended by the United States Border Patrol. Following their arrest, the alien and the other passengers were interviewed by criminal investigators. The alien and his three passengers admitted that they were illegally in the country and all of the passengers identified the alien as the driver of the car. An Assistant United States Attorney concluded that the passengers possessed no evidence material to the prosecution or defense of the alien-defendant for transporting illegal aliens, and two of the passengers were deported to Mexico, while the third was detained to provide a non-hearsay basis for establishing that the defendant had transported an illegal alien in violation of 8 USCS 1324(a)(2). On trial in the United States District Court for the Southern District of California, the defendant moved to dismiss the indictment, claiming that the government's deportation of two of the passengers violated his Fifth Amendment right to due process of law and his Sixth Amendment right to compulsory process for obtaining favorable witnesses, claiming that the deportation had deprived him of the opportunity to interview the two remaining passengers to determine whether they could aid in his defense. The District Court denied the defendant's motion and, following a bench trial on stipulated evidence, found the defendant guilty as charged. The United States Court of Appeals for the Ninth Circuit reversed the conviction holding that the government violated the Fifth and Sixth Amendments when it deported the alien witnesses before counsel had an opportunity to interview them (647 F2d 72).",lexis
"Physicians who provide abortion services brought a class action in the United States District Court for the Northern District of Illinois challenging the constitutionality of an Illinois abortion law and seeking declaratory and injunctive relief. A pediatrician moved to intervene as a party defendant and to be appointed guardian ad litem for fetuses who survive abortion, based on his conscientious objection to abortions and on his status as a pediatrician and as a parent of an unemancipated minor daughter. The District Court granted the motion, without indicating whether the intervention was permissive or as of right. Ultimately, the District Court permanently enjoined the enforcement of certain provisions of the law which impose criminal liability on physicians for violating prescribed standards of care for performing abortions and the requirements for furnishing a patient with particular abortion-related information (579 F Supp 464). The United States Court of Appeals for the Seventh Circuit affirmed and also permanently enjoined the enforcement of another provision (749 F2d 452). The pediatrician filed a notice of appeal to the United States Supreme Court and a jurisdictional statement. The state of Illinois did not appeal, but filed a ""letter of interest"" with the Supreme Court under Supreme Court Rule 10.4, stating in the letter that the state's interest was identical to that advanced by it in the lower courts and was essentially coterminous with the pediatrician's position.",lexis
"Under the standard of proof established by the United States Supreme Court in Batson v Kentucky (1986) 476 US 79, 90 L Ed 2d 69, 106 S Ct 1712, if a state criminal defendant makes a prima facie showing that a prosecutor, in violation of the equal protection clause of the Federal Constitution's Fourteenth Amendment, has exercised peremptory challenges on the basis of race, then the burden shifts to the prosecutor to articulate a race-neutral explanation for striking the jurors in question. In a criminal trial in the New York Supreme Court, Kings County, defense counsel objected that the prosecutor had used peremptory challenges to exclude allegedly Latino--that is, Hispanic--potential jurors. With respect to two of the challenged venirepersons, one of whom was Latino while the other's Latino status was uncertain, the prosecutor offered an explanation to the effect that while he would have no motive to exclude Latinos from the jury, as the alleged victims and the prosecutor's proposed main witnesses were Latinos, he was supposedly not certain whether the two venirepersons in question would have accepted an interpreter as the final arbiter of what was said by Spanish-speaking witnesses. The trial court rejected the defense claims, and the defendant was eventually convicted of attempted murder and criminal possession of a weapon. On appeal, the New York Supreme Court, Appellate Division, in affirming, expressed the view that the prosecutor had offered race-neutral explanations for the peremptory challenges, which explanations were sufficient to rebut the defendant's prima facie case (140 App Div 2d 543, 528 NYS2d 625). On appeal, the Court of Appeals of New York, in affirming, (1) deferred to the factual findings of the lower New York courts; and (2) ruled that the prosecutor had offered a legitimate basis for challenging the individuals in question (75 NYS2d 350, 553 NYS2d 85, 552 NE2d 621).",lexis
"The projects involved placing sand along beaches seaward from the mean high-water line, which was the boundary between the state's submerged land and the owners' properties. The corporation contended that the state's ownership of the new dry land to seaward deprived the owners of their rights to accretion and a water boundary, and that the state court's decision was a taking of the owners' properties. While their was no consensus concerning whether a judicial decision could effect a taking, or whether it was even necessary to address the issue, the U.S. Supreme Court unanimously held that there was no taking of the owners' property rights. Since the change in the mean high-water line resulted from a relatively sudden avulsion, rather than a gradual accretion, the newly exposed land remained property of the state and the previous mean high-water line remained the boundary between the properties of the state and the owners. Thus, prior to the state court's decision the owners had no rights to future accretions and to contact with the water superior to the state's right to fill in its submerged land, and any further seaward accretion became property of the state.",lexis

"A state court prisoner initiated habeas corpus proceedings in the United States District Court for the Southern District of Iowa, alleging that the introduction of certain incriminating evidence against him in a state murder prosecution had violated his constitutional right to the assistance of counsel. The challenged evidence was based on disclosures made by the prisoner to police officers in the absence of his attorney. The prisoner, on the advice by telephone of his counsel in Des Moines, Iowa, surrendered to police officials in Davenport, Iowa, and was booked on the charge of abducting a 10-year-old girl in Des Moines. The prisoner was then advised by his Des Moines attorney, by telephone, that Des Moines police officers would be driving to Davenport to pick him up, and that the prisoner should not talk to the officers about the girl until after consulting with the attorney upon his return to Des Moines. It was agreed between the attorney and Des Moines officials that the officers would not question the prisoner during the trip. In the meantime, the prisoner was arraigned before a judge in Davenport on the abduction charge, was advised of his Miranda rights, and was committed to jail. Before leaving the courtroom, the prisoner conferred with another lawyer, who advised him not to make any statements until consulting with his attorney back in Des Moines. When the Des Moines officers arrived in Davenport, one of them repeated the Miranda warnings to the prisoner and was reminded by his Davenport attorney that the prisoner was not to be questioned about the disappearance of the girl until after he had consulted with his attorney in Des Moines. During the trip to Des Moines, the prisoner did not express a willingness to be interrogated in the absence of an attorney, but rather stated several times that he would tell the whole story after seeing his attorney in Des Moines. However, one of the officers sought to obtain incriminating evidence from the prisoner by telling him that they should stop and locate the girl's body because her parents were entitled to a ""Christian burial"" for the girl, who had been taken from them on Christmas Eve. The prisoner subsequently made several incriminating disclosures, and then directed the officers to the body. Notwithstanding his objections to the admission of evidence resulting from those disclosures, the prisoner was tried and convicted for first degree murder, and the conviction was affirmed by the Iowa Supreme Court. The prisoner's petition in Federal District Court for a writ of habeas corpus was granted on the ground that as a matter of law, the evidence in question had been wrongly admitted at trial (375 F Supp 170), and the United States Court of Appeals for the Eighth Circuit affirmed (509 F2d 227).",lexis

At a probable cause hearing the next day to obtain a search warrant, (1) one of the officers testified, in response to the deputy prosecutor's questioning, that the mother had confessed; (2) neither the officer nor the deputy prosecutor told the judge that the ""confession"" had been obtained under hypnosis or that the mother had otherwise denied the shooting; and (3) the judge issued a search warrant. The mother was charged under Indiana law with the attempted murder of her sons, but the trial judge granted the mother's pretrial motion to suppress the statements under hypnosis, and, as a result, the prosecutor's office dropped all charges against the mother.

The Act, under 25 USCS 2710(d)(3), imposed on a state a duty to negotiate in good faith with an Indian tribe toward the formation between the tribe and the state of a compact concerning gaming activities by the tribe in the state.

In addition, 9(a)(1)(B) of the Act (16 USCS 1538(a)(1)(B)) generally makes it unlawful for any person to ""take"" any endangered or threatened species of fish or wildlife, although 10(a)(1)(B) of the Act (16 USCS 1539(a)(1)(B))--which Congress added by amendment in 1982--authorizes the Secretary to grant a permit for any taking otherwise prohibited by 9(a)(1)(B) if such taking is incidental to, and not the purpose of, the carrying out of an otherwise lawful activity. The term ""take"" is defined in 3(19) of the Act (16 USCS 1532(19)) to mean to harass, harm, pursue, hunt, shoot, wound, kill, trap, capture, or collect, or to attempt to engage in any such conduct.

"In 1968, a diversified holding company acquired about 65% of the stock of a bank. As a result of federal legislation, enacted in 1970, pertaining to bank holding companies, the holding company, in 1971, filed a notice of divestiture and began trying to sell its bank stock. Because the bank had made a series of bad loans, selling the bank stock proved difficult. While trying to sell its bank stock, the holding company, in response to the concerns of federal regulators that the bank was not adequately capitalized, bought additional shares of the bank's stock. By 1974, the holding company more than tripled the number of shares it owned in the bank, although its percentage interest remained relatively stable. In 1975, the holding company was finally able to sell most of its bank stock. On its federal income tax return for 1975, the holding company claimed a deduction for an ordinary loss resulting from the sale of the bank stock. The Commissioner of Internal Revenue disallowed the ordinary loss deduction, ruling that the loss incurred was a capital loss rather than an ordinary loss and was therefore subject to the capital loss limitations of the Internal Revenue Code. The holding company challenged this determination in the United States Tax Court, which held that bank stock purchased by the holding company through 1972 was purchased with a substantial investment purpose and was thus a ""capital asset"" within the meaning of 26 USCS 1221, so that, when sold, it gave rise to a capital loss, while bank stock purchased by the holding company after 1972 was held for a business purpose, without any substantial investment motive, and was thus an ordinary asset whose sale gave rise to an ordinary loss (83 TC 640). On appeal, the United States Court of Appeals for the Eighth Circuit reversed in part, holding that, regardless of the purpose for which it was acquired, all of the bank stock sold in 1975 (1) was included within the general definition of ""capital asset"" in 1221, (2) fell outside any of the specific statutory exceptions to this definition, and (3) was thus subject to capital-loss treatment (800 F2d 215).",lexis

In addition, state law made it a felony to pay any person, corporation, or association to circulate an initiative petition. In 1984, proponents of an amendment to the Colorado Constitution that would have removed motor carriers from the jurisdiction of the state public utilities commission brought an action under 42 USCS 1983 against state officials. In the action, the proponents sought a declaration that the prohibition against the use of paid circulators violated the proponents' rights under the Federal Constitution's First and Fourteenth Amendments. The District Court upheld the prohibition, and a panel of the United States Court of Appeals for the Tenth Circuit affirmed, but on rehearing en banc, the Court of Appeals reversed, on the grounds that (1) the prohibition impeded the proponents' opportunity to disseminate their views to the public, and (2) various justifications asserted by the state were inadequate to support the prohibition (828 F2d 1446).",lexis
"The petitioner applied some 9 months after his induction into the Army for a discharge as a conscientious objector, but was denied such status on the grounds that his professed beliefs had become fixed prior to entering the service and that his opposition to war was not truly based upon his religious beliefs. Thereafter, the petitioner applied to the Army Board for Correction of Military Records (ABCMR) for administrative review of that determination, and he also commenced a habeas corpus proceeding in the United States District Court for the Northern District of California, claiming that the Army's denial of his conscientious objector application was without basis in fact. The District Court declined at that time to consider the merits of the petition, but it did retain jurisdiction pending a decision by the ABCMR, and enjoined Army authorities from requiring the petitioner to participate in activities or training beyond his current noncombatant duties. After attempts to win a stay of a redeployment order had been rejected both by the Court of Appeals for the Ninth Circuit and by Mr. Justice Douglas, acting as Circuit Justice (396 US 1233, 24 L Ed 2d 482, 90 S Ct 497), the petitioner reported to Fort Lewis, Washington, as he had been ordered to do, but refused to obey an order to board a plane for Vietnam, as a result of which failure the petitioner was charged with wilful disobedience of a lawful command of a superior commissioned officer, and was convicted of that offense by a court- martial. While the court-martial charges were pending, the ABCMR rejected the petitioner's application for relief, and thereafter, on the government's motion at a show cause hearing, the District Court entered an order deferring consideration of the habeas corpus petition until final determination of the criminal charge then pending in the military court system, which order was affirmed by the Court of Appeals (435 F2d 299).",lexis
"The plaintiff, a private university which refused to admit Negroes as students, instituted an action in the United States District Court for the District of South Carolina, seeking to enjoin the Internal Revenue Service--pursuant to its decision to no longer allow tax-exempt status under 501(c)(3) of the Internal Revenue Code of 1954 (26 USCS 501(c)(3)) for private schools maintaining racially discriminatory admissions policies--from revoking its ruling letter declaring that the plaintiff qualified for tax-exempt status, and from withdrawing advance assurance to the plaintiff's donors that contributions to the plaintiff would constitute charitable deductions for the donors under 26 USCS 170(c)(2). The plaintiff contended that the Service's threatened action was outside its lawful authority and would violate the plaintiff's First Amendment, due process, and equal protection rights. The District Court granted a preliminary injunction against the Service pending a decision on the merits, holding that the suit was not precluded by the Anti-Injunction Act of the Internal Revenue Code of 1954 (26 USCS 7421(a)), which provides in general that no suit for the purpose of restraining the assessment or collection of any tax shall be maintained in any court by any person, whether or not such person is the person against whom such tax was assessed (341 F Supp 277).

Although the department did not restrict access either to the pressroom or to the reports made available therein, the room contained signs to the effect that the names of rape victims were not matters of public record and were not to be published. A reporter-trainee for a weekly newspaper copied the police report verbatim, including the victim's full name, and a reporter for the newspaper prepared an article, derived entirely from the copied police report, which again included the victim's full name.

The victim, claiming emotional distress, filed suit in the Circuit Court of Duval County against the sheriff's department and the newspaper. The victim alleged that the newspaper had violated a Florida statute that made it unlawful to publish in any instrument of mass communication the name of the victim of a sexual offense. The department reached a pretrial settlement with the victim, but following a trial, the newspaper was found negligent and the victim was awarded compensatory and punitive damages.

"Two drug rehabilitation counselors, both of whom were members of the Native American Church, were fired from their jobs with a private corporation in Oregon because they had ingested peyote, a hallucinogenic drug, for sacramental purposes at a ceremony of the Church. The counselors applied to the Employment Division of Oregon's Department of Human Resources for unemployment compensation, but the department's Employment Appeals Board ultimately denied their applications on the ground that the counselors had been discharged for misconduct connected with work. The Oregon Court of Appeals, reversing the board's decisions, (1) held that the denial of benefits to persons who were discharged for engaging in a religious act constituted an unjustified burden on the right of free exercise of religion, and (2) remanded the cases to the board for further findings as to the religious nature of the counselors' acts (75 Or App 764, 707 P2d 1274, 709 P2d 246). The Supreme Court of Oregon, holding that such further findings were unnecessary and that the counselors were entitled to payment of unemployment benefits, affirmed both judgments as modified (301 Or 209, 221, 721 P2d 445, 451). On certiorari, the United States Supreme Court (1) noted that the Oregon Supreme Court had not decided whether the counselors' sacramental use of peyote was in fact proscribed by Oregon's controlled substance law, and that this issue was a matter of dispute between the parties, (2) determined that it would not be appropriate, given this uncertainty, for the United States Supreme Court to decide whether the practice was protected by the Federal Constitution, and accordingly (3) vacated the Oregon Supreme Court's judgment and remanded the case for further proceedings (485 US 660, 99 L Ed 2d 753, 108 S Ct 1444). On remand, the Oregon Supreme Court held that (1) the Oregon statute made no exception for the sacramental use of peyote, (2) the counselors' use of peyote thus fell within the prohibition of the statute, (3) the prohibition of the practice at issue was not valid under the free exercise clause of the Federal Constitution's First Amendment, and (4) the counselors could not be denied unemployment benefits for having engaged in that practice (307 Or 68, 763 P2d 146).",lexis

The United States Supreme Court determined that the recusal provision of the Ethics in Government Law was not unconstitutionally overbroad under the First Amendment because legislators lacked a personal First Amendment right to vote on any given matter. A legislator's vote was not protected speech, because, inter alia, (1) the belief that recusal rules violated legislators' First Amendment rights was inconsistent with early congressional enactments and long-standing state traditions, (2) a legislator's vote was the commitment of his apportioned share of the legislature's power to the passage or defeat of a particular proposal and the legislative power thus committed was not personal to the legislator but belonged to the people, (3) the fact that a nonsymbolic act was the product of a deeply held personal belief did not transform action into First Amendment speech, and (4) a legislator had no right to use official powers for expressive purposes.",lexis
"In 1984, a 4-year-old boy in Winnebago County, Wisconsin, was severely beaten by his natural father. The resulting brain damage was so great that the boy was expected to spend the rest of his life in an institution for the profoundly retarded. The boy and his mother brought suit under 42 USCS 1983 in the United States District Court for the Eastern District of Wisconsin against the county, its department of social services (DSS), and various individual DSS employees. The complaint alleged that the county, the DSS, and the individual employees had deprived the boy of his liberty without due process of law, in violation of his rights under the due process clause of the Federal Constitution's Fourteenth Amendment, by failing to intervene to protect him against a risk of violence of which they knew or should have known. The evidence showed that the county first received a report that the boy might be a victim of child abuse in January 1982. A year later, the boy was hospitalized with multiple bruises and abrasions. The DSS obtained an order from a juvenile court which placed the boy in the temporary custody of the hospital. On the recommendation of a ""child protection team,"" consisting of a pediatrician, a psychologist, a police detective, the county's lawyer, several DSS caseworkers, and various hospital personnel, the juvenile court dismissed the case and returned the boy to the custody of his father, who promised to cooperate with the DSS. During 1983, the boy was hospitalized twice for suspicious injuries, and a DSS caseworker who made monthly visits to the boy's home recorded in her files her continuing suspicions of child abuse, but the DSS took no action. The District Court, holding that a state agency's failure to render protective services to persons within its jurisdiction does not violate the due process clause, dismissed the boy's claim. The United States Court of Appeals for the Seventh Circuit affirmed, holding that (1) the due process clause does not require a state or local governmental entity to protect its citizens from private violence, and (2) the causal connection between the county's conduct and the boy's injuries was too attenuated to establish a deprivation of constitutional rights actionable under 1983 (812 F2d 298).",lexis
"Before trial in the United States District Court for the District of Massachusetts on an indictment charging the defendant with refusing to submit to military induction, the defendant moved to dismiss the indictment on the grounds that (1) the government's military involvement in Vietnam violated international law, (2) he reasonably believed that involvement to be illegal, and (3) the Military Selective Service Act and its regulations were unconstitutional because the procedures followed by local boards lacked due process and because compulsory conscription during peacetime was unnecessary and stifling to fundamental personal liberties. The District Court denied the motion (294 F Supp 511, 515). Although the defendant did not try to prove that he should have received a conscientious objector exemption, evidence bearing on that issue was brought out at trial, but no conscientious objector issue was submitted to the jury, which was instructed to determine whether the defendant's refusal to submit to induction was ""unlawful, knowingly, and wilfully"" done. After the jury returned a verdict of guilty, the District Court, granting what it termed a motion in arrest of judgment, held that the defendant could not be criminally convicted for refusing induction, because such a conviction would violate his rights of conscience as a nonreligious objector to the Vietnam War, but not wars in general, under the free exercise and establishment of religion clauses of the First Amendment and the due process clause of the Fifth Amendment (297 F Supp 902). The government sought United States Supreme Court review pursuant to the provision of the Criminal Appeals Act which allows such an appeal from a District Court decision ""arresting a judgment of conviction for insufficiency of the indictment or information, where such decision is based upon the invalidity or construction of the statute upon which the indictment or information is founded.""",lexis

(365 F2d 802.) The Court of Appeals held that the action should have been dismissed (1) because the automobile owner, who could not be joined as a defendant without destroying diversity jurisdiction and whose rights were affected by the judgment, had a substantive right to be joined, which right was unaffected by the provisions of Rule 19 of the Federal Rules of Civil Procedure relating to the joinder of persons if feasible, and to a determination by the court whether in equity and good conscience the action should be dismissed or allowed to proceed if joinder is not feasible, and (2) because the issue involved was before the state courts in two pending tort actions based on the same collision, and the District Court thus should have declined jurisdiction in order to allow the state courts to settle the question of state law.",lexis
"In January 1983, a woman lost control of her car as she traveled down a Missouri road. The car overturned, and a state trooper discovered the woman, lying face down in a ditch, without detectable respiratory or cardiac function. Paramedics who arrived at the accident scene were able to restore the woman's breathing and heartbeat, and the woman was then transported to a hospital in an unconscious state. An attending neurosurgeon diagnosed the woman as having sustained probable cerebral contusions compounded by significant oxygen deprivation, or anoxia. The estimated length of the period of her anoxia was 12 to 14 minutes; permanent brain damage generally results, the trial court later found, after 6 minutes in an anoxic state. The woman remained in a coma for approximately 3 weeks, and then progressed to an unconscious state in which she was able to orally ingest some nutrition. In order to ease feeding and further the woman's recovery, surgeons implanted a gastrostomy feeding and hydration tube with the consent of her then husband. In October 1983, the woman was admitted to a state hospital. Subsequent rehabilitative efforts proved unavailing. After it became apparent that the woman had virtually no chance of regaining her mental faculties, her parents--who had been appointed as her coguardians--asked employees of the state hospital to terminate the artificial nutrition and hydration procedures. The employees refused to honor the request without court approval. The parents then filed a declaratory judgment action in a Missouri trial court, in which they sought judicial authorization of their request. A guardian ad litem was appointed for the woman. The trial court, following a hearing, entered an order directing the employees to cause the parents' request to be carried out, based upon its findings that (1) the woman (a) had unassisted respiration and circulation function within the normal limits of a 30-year-old female, (b) was oblivious to her environment except for reflexive responses to sound and perhaps to painful stimuli, (c) suffered anoxia of the brain resulting in a massive enlargement of the ventricles filling with cerebrospinal fluid where the brain had degenerated, and cerebral cortical atrophy which was irreversible, permanent, progressive, and ongoing, (d) exhibited her highest cognitive brain function by grimacing, perhaps in recognition of ordinarily painful stimuli, which indicated the experience of pain and apparent response to sound, (e) was a spastic quadriplegic, (f) suffered contracture of her four extremities, with irreversible muscle and tendon damage, and (g) had no cognitive or reflex ability to swallow food or water to maintain her daily essential needs, and would never recover such ability; (2) a person in the woman's condition had a fundamental right under the Missouri and Federal Constitutions to refuse or direct the withdrawal of ""death prolonging procedures""; and (3) the woman's expressed thoughts at age 25, in somewhat serious conversation with her housemate, that if sick or injured, she would not wish to continue her life unless she could live at least halfway normally, suggested that the woman would not wish to continue on with her nutrition and hydration given her present condition. Both the state and the guardian ad litem appealed. The Supreme Court of Missouri, reversing, expressed the view that (1) although the woman was in a ""persistent vegetative state,"" she was neither dead within the meaning of Missouri's statutory definition of death nor terminally ill; (2) the woman's right to refuse treatment--whether such right proceeded from a constitutional right of privacy or a common-law right to refuse treatment--did not outweigh Missouri's strong policy favoring the preservation of life, as embodied in the Missouri living will statute; (3) the woman's conversation with her housemate was unreliable for the purpose of determining her intent, and thus insufficient to support the parents' claim to exercise substituted judgment on the woman's behalf; and (4) no person could assume the choice of terminating medical treatment for an incompetent person in the absence of either the formalities required under the living will statute or ""clear and convincing, inherently reliable evidence,"" which was absent in the case at hand (760 SW2d 408).",lexis

The United States Court of Appeals for the Seventh Circuit, in reversing and remanding for a new trial, concluded that (1) reason and experience compelled recognition of a psychotherapist-patient privilege under Rule 501 of the Federal Rules of Evidence, and (2) the trial court in the case at hand erred by refusing to afford protection to the confidential communications between the officer and the social worker (51 F3d 1346).",lexis

"A public high school in Omaha, Nebraska permitted students to join groups and clubs meeting after school hours on school premises, and had recognized about 30 groups, including a chess club, a scuba-diving club, and a service group working with special education classes. A school board policy required each club to have faculty sponsorship; there was no written policy as to the formation of student clubs, but students wishing to form a club would present their request to a school official, who determined whether the proposed club was consistent with school board policies and with the school district's commitment to teaching skills and values. A group of students at the high school requested permission to form a Christian club, for the purpose of reading and discussing the Bible, having fellowship, and praying together, with membership to be voluntary and open to all regardless of religious affiliation. School officials denied the request on the grounds that the proposed club would not or could not have a faculty sponsor, and that a religious club at the school would violate the establishment clause of the Federal Constitution's First Amendment. The students, by and through their parents as ""next friends,"" filed in the United States District Court for the District of Nebraska an action for declaratory and injunctive relief against the school board and various individual officials, which action was based on the claim that the refusal to allow the proposed club to meet at the school violated, among other laws, the Equal Access Act (EAA) (20 USCS 4071-4074)--which provides, in part, that (1) public secondary schools which receive federal assistance and have a ""limited open forum"" may not deny equal access to that forum to students wishing to conduct a meeting, on the basis of the religious, political, or other content of the speech at such a meeting ( 4071(a)), and (2) a ""limited open forum"" exists where a school allows ""noncurriculum related student groups"" to meet on school premises during noninstructional time ( 4071(b)). The District Court, entering judgment for the defendants, held that the high school did not have a ""limited open forum"" within the terms of the EAA, because all of the school's student clubs were curriculum-related and tied to the educational function of the school. However, the United States Court of Appeals for the Eighth Circuit reversed, as it held that (1) the high school maintained a ""limited open forum"" within the meaning of the EAA, and was therefore barred from discriminating against the proposed club on the basis of its religious content, because several of the existing student clubs--including the chess club--were ""noncurriculum related""; and (2) the EAA did not violate the establishment clause (867 F2d 1076).",lexis

Investigating a complaint, the Federal Election Commission (FEC) found probable cause to believe that this publication violated the provision of 316 of the Federal Election Campaign Act (2 USCS 441b) which bars corporations from using treasury funds to make expenditures in connection with any election to any public office. After conciliation efforts failed, the FEC filed a complaint against the corporation in the United States District Court for the District of Massachusetts, seeking a civil penalty and other appropriate relief. The District Court dismissed the complaint, holding (1) that the special edition did not violate 441b, and (2) that if 441b did prohibit this publication, then it violated First Amendment freedoms of speech, press, and association as applied to this corporation (589 F Supp 646).

A parent of children attending the public schools intervened in support of the action. The Chancery Court held that the statute violated the Fourteenth Amendment to the United States Constitution, but on appeal the Supreme Court of Arkansas reversed, sustaining the statute as an exercise of the state's power to specify the curriculum in public schools, while expressing no opinion on whether the statute prohibited any explanation of the theory of evolution or merely prohibited teaching that the theory was true.

"A town in New York State adopted a flow control ordinance requiring that before leaving the town, all nonrecyclable nonhazardous solid waste generated within the town, or generated outside the town and brought into the town, be processed at a designated transfer station that, under an agreement between the town and a local private contractor calling for the contractor to construct the station and operate it for 5 years, was to be purchased by the town from the contractor for $ 1 after the 5-year period. In order to amortize the cost of the transfer station, the town was allowing the contractor to charge haulers who deposited waste at the station a tipping fee of $ 81 per ton, which rate exceeded the disposal cost of unsorted solid waste on the private market. After a company, which was engaged in the processing of solid waste and operated in the town a recycling center similar to the town's transfer station, was discovered to be shipping nonrecyclable waste from the town to other states, the town sought an injunction in the New York Supreme Court, Rockland County, requiring the company to ship such waste to the transfer station. The company responded by suing in the United States District Court for the Southern District of New York to enjoin the flow control ordinance. Finding a sufficient likelihood that the ordinance violated the Federal Constitution's commerce clause (Art I, 8, cl 3), the District Court granted the injunction sought by the company (770 F Supp 848). Subsequently the New York Supreme Court granted summary judgment to the town and ordered the company to comply with the ordinance. The District Court then dissolved its injunction.

"The issue in the present case was whether federal admiralty law or state law governed the validity and scope of warranties in a marine insurance contract. The owners, residents of Texas, insured a small houseboat against loss from fire. The boat was used for commercial carriage of passengers on Lake Texoma, an artificial inland lake between Texas and Oklahoma. While moored on the lake, the boat was destroyed by fire. In an action brought in Texas for the loss by the original owners and a corporation wholly owned by them, to which the boat's legal title had been transferred, the insurer denied liability because of breaches of policy warranties providing that, without the insurer's consent, the boat could not be transferred and that it must be used solely for private pleasure purposes. Without finding whether the policy had been made and delivered in Texas and refusing to give any effect to Texas law, under which the policy provisions containing the warranties might have been void, the courts below decided in favor of the insurer, applying, as a matter of federal admiralty law, the ""literal performance"" rule, which requires literal fulfilment of every policy warranty so that any breach bars recovery, even though a loss would have happened had the warranty been carried out to the letter.",lexis

"In Batson v Kentucky (1986) 476 US 79, 90 L Ed 2d 69, 106 S Ct 1712, which involved a black defendant in a state criminal case, the United States Supreme Court held that the equal protection clause of the Federal Constitution's Fourteenth Amendment would be violated by a prosecutor's purposefully discriminatory exercise of peremptory challenges to remove from the jury venire members of the defendant's own race. Several subsequent Supreme Court cases decided various issues--criminal and civil, federal and state--with respect to claims of racial discrimination in the exercise of peremptory challenges. The case at hand arose when the state of Alabama, on behalf of the mother of a minor child, filed a complaint in the District Court of Jackson County, Alabama, against a male individual as to paternity and child support. After jury selection began in 1991, the state used 9 of its 10 peremptory strikes to remove male jurors. The individual objected, claiming that the state's peremptory challenges had been exercised against male jurors solely on the basis of gender, in violation of the Fourteenth Amendment's equal protection clause under the logic and reasoning of Batson v Kentucky. The District Court, however, (1) rejected the individual's claim; (2) impanelled an all-female jury; and (3) after the jury found the individual to be the child's father, entered an order directing the individual to pay child support. On postjudgment motion, the District Court reaffirmed its ruling that Batson v Kentucky did not extend to gender-based peremptory challenges. The Alabama Court of Civil Appeals, in affirming the District Court's judgment, expressed the view that under Alabama precedent, the Batson v Kentucky principle did not extend to gender-based peremptory strikes (606 So 2d 156).

The U.S. Supreme Court held that, if the punitive damages award was based in part on the jury's desire to punish the manufacturer for harming nonparties, such an award amounted to a taking of property from the manufacturer without due process. While it was permissible to consider nonparty harm in determining reprehensibility, the punitive damages award to punish the manufacturer for injury inflicted on strangers to the litigation, without an opportunity to defend the charge, violated due process. Thus, procedures were required to inform the jury that, while harm to nonparties was relevant to reprehensibility, punitive damages could not be awarded to punish the manufacturer for such harm.",lexis

The District Court rendered judgment in favor of the supervisor and the bank without resolving that factual issue, holding (1) that the employee had not made out a case of sexual discrimination because any relationship that might have existed had been voluntary and had never been made a condition of the employee's continued employment or advancement, and (2) that the bank could not be held liable for the supervisor's alleged actions because it had not received any notice about his supposed offensive conduct (22 EPD 30708, 23 FEP Cases 37). The United States Court of Appeals for the District of Columbia Circuit reversed and remanded, holding that an infringement of Title VII is not necessarily dependent upon the victim's loss of employment or promotion, that the voluntariness of the alleged sexual relationship was immaterial, and that an employer is liable for sexual harassment of a subordinate by a supervisor regardless of whether the employer knew or should have known about the harassment (243 App DC 323, 753 F2d 141, rehearing en banc denied 245 App DC 306, 760 F2d 1330).",lexis
"After being convicted in a New Jersey state court for the gang-related murder of a police officer, a person claimed that the prosecution had withheld material exculpatory evidence. Seeking evidence to support this claim, the person filed a request with the Federal Bureau of Investigation (FBI), pursuant to the Freedom of Information Act (FOIA) (5 USCS 552), for information that the FBI had compiled in the course of investigating the murder. The FBI, although releasing much information, redacted some documents and completely withheld others. The requester filed an action in the United States District Court for the District of New Jersey seeking disclosure of the entire contents of the requested files. The FBI claimed that the undisclosed information was subject to various FOIA exemptions, and that some of the information had been withheld pursuant to Exemption 7(D) of the FOIA (5 USCS 552(b)(7)(D)), which exempts from disclosure agency records compiled for law enforcement purposes by criminal law enforcement authority in the course of a criminal investigation if release of those records could reasonably be expected to disclose the identity of, or information provided by, a ""confidential source."" The District Court, granting summary judgment to the requester, expressed the view that the Federal Government had not articulated sufficient reasons for failing to disclose some of the information withheld under Exemption 7(D) (751 F Supp 502, clarified on reconsideration 758 F Supp 1021). On appeal, the United States Court of Appeals for the Third Circuit, affirming in relevant part, (1) rejected the argument that a presumption of confidentiality arises under Exemption 7(D) as to any source that supplies information to the FBI during a criminal investigation; (2) declined to rule that such a presumption may be based on the subject matter of a particular investigation; and (3) expressed the view that in order to justify withholding information under Exemption 7(D), the Government had to provide detailed explanations relating to each alleged confidential source (956 F2d 422).",lexis
"The mother of a mentally retarded person, who was involuntarily committed to a Pennsylvania state institution upon her petition and who was injured on numerous occasions while a patient at the institution, filed a complaint, as her son's next friend, in the United States District Court for the Eastern District of Pennsylvania under 42 USCS 1983, seeking damages against the institution's officials, and alleging that these officials knew, or should have known, that her son was suffering injuries and that they failed to institute appropriate preventive procedures, thereby violating his rights under the Eighth and Fourteenth Amendments. A second amended complaint was filed, alleging that the officials were restraining her son for prolonged periods on a routine basis, and claiming damages for the official's failure to provide him with appropriate treatment or programs for his mental retardation. At the close of trial, the District Court instructed the jury on the assumption that the proper standard of liability was that of the Eighth Amendment, and verdict was returned for the officials. The United States Court of Appeals for the Third Circuit reversed and remanded for a new trial, holding that the Eighth Amendment was not an appropriate source for determining the rights of the involuntarily committed, but that the Fourteenth Amendment, and the liberty interest protected therein, provided the proper constitutional basis for these rights (644 F2d 147).",lexis

The father and his second wife filed in Chancery Court in Mississippi a civil suit seeking to terminate the natural mother's parental rights, and to gain approval for adoption of the children by the second wife. The chancellor--in a decree that (1) recited a state statute's language authorizing termination of parental rights on the basis of a substantial erosion of the relationship between the parent and child which was caused at least in part by the parent's serious neglect, abuse, prolonged and unreasonable absence, or unreasonable failure to visit or communicate with the child; and (2) stated that the father and his second wife had met their burden of proof by clear and convincing evidence; but (3) did not describe the evidence or otherwise reveal precisely the reasons for the chancellor's decision--terminated all parental rights of the natural mother, approved the adoption, and ordered that the second wife be shown on the children's birth certificates as their mother. State statutory provisions granted civil litigants the right to appeal, but conditioned that right on prepayment of costs. The natural mother filed a timely appeal and, being unable to pay the required record preparation fees, sought leave to proceed in forma pauperis.

"After their applications for absentee ballots for a primary election had been denied by the Chicago Board of Elections Commissioners, the plaintiffs, who were awaiting trial as inmates of the jail of Cook County, Illinois, the county of their residence, and who were unable to readily appear at the polls either because they were charged with nonbailable offenses or because they were unable to post the bail imposed by the Illinois courts, instituted an action in the United States District Court for the Northern District of Illinois, challenging the constitutionality of an Illinois statute which made absentee balloting available to certain persons, including those absent from their county of residence for any reason, and those who were physically incapacitated and presented a doctor's affidavit to such effect. The plaintiffs contended that the statutory scheme violated the equal protection clause of the Fourteenth Amendment in failing to provide coverage for them, since the distinction allowing absentee balloting to those physically incapacitated but not to those judicially incapacitated was not reasonable, and since other pretrial jail inmates incarcerated outside their county of residence could qualify for an absentee ballot under the statutory provision for persons absent from their county of residence for any reason.

"A police officer investigating an armed robbery determined that there was probable cause to search the accused's home for the property stolen in the robbery and for the weapons used by the robbers. The warrant authorizing the search of the accused's home, however, authorized a search for only the stolen property. The officer searched the accused's home pursuant to the warrant but found no stolen property. In the course of the search, the officer discovered the robbery weapons in plain view and seized the weapons and several other items. The officer testified that while he was searching for the stolen property, he also was interested in finding other evidence connecting the accused to the crime. At the accused's trial in a California state court, the court refused to suppress the items found in the accused's home, and the accused was convicted after a jury trial. Affirming the conviction, the California Court of Appeal rejected the accused's argument that, because the officer's discovery of the seized items not listed in the search warrant was not inadvertent, the decision of the United States Supreme Court in Coolidge v New Hampshire (1971) 403 US 443, 29 L Ed 2d 564, 91 S Ct 2022, required their suppression under the Fourth Amendment.

The agents, with the seller's consent, substituted their own can containing the beeper for one of the cans in the shipment. By monitoring the beeper, agents determined that the can of ether was moved several times, and the agents eventually tracked the ether to the defendants' residence. The beeper revealed that the ether can was inside the house. The agents then obtained a warrant to search the house based in part on information derived through use of the beeper. The defendants were indicted for conspiring to possess cocaine with intent to distribute it and with the underlying offense, but the United States District Court for the District of New Mexico granted the defendants' pretrial motion to suppress the evidence seized from the house on the grounds that the initial warrant to install the beeper was invalid and that the seizure was the tainted fruit of an unauthorized installation and monitoring of that beeper.

A state postconviction court found that such a motion would have been fruitless in light of the other admissible confession. The Supreme Court held that the inmate was not entitled to habeas relief under ¬¨√ü 2254(d) because the state court decision was not an unreasonable application of clearly established federal law. Under the circumstances, which included the potential for a capital charge, it was not unreasonable to conclude that counsel's decision to opt for a quick plea bargain did not amount to deficient performance.

"The Department of Corrections for the state of Washington maintained a Special Offender Center to diagnose and treat convicted felons who were state prisoners and had serious mental disorders. The center had a written policy providing that (1) if a psychiatrist determined that a prisoner should be treated with antipsychotic drugs but the prisoner did not consent, the prisoner was entitled to a hearing before a committee consisting of a psychiatrist, a psychologist, and the associate superintendent of the center, none of whom could be, at the time of the hearing, involved in the prisoner's treatment or diagnosis; (2) the prisoner could be subjected to involuntary treatment with the drugs only if the committee determined by a majority vote, in which the psychiatrist was in the majority, that the prisoner (a) suffered from a mental disorder, and (b) was gravely disabled or posed a likelihood of serious harm to himself, others, or their property; (3) the prisoner had the right to (a) be notified of the center's intent to convene the hearing, (b) attend the hearing, (c) present evidence and witnesses, (d) cross-examine staff witnesses, (e) be assisted by a lay adviser who had not been involved in the case but understood the psychiatric issues involved, (f) appeal the committee's decision to the Superintendent of the center, and (g) seek judicial review of the committee's decision in a state court; and (4) after the initial hearing, involuntary treatment could continue only with periodic review by the Department of Corrections. After involuntary-treatment proceedings were conducted in accordance with the center's policy, a prisoner was involuntarily treated with antipsychotic drugs, subject to the periodic reviews of the prisoner's case required under the policy. While being subjected to involuntary treatment at the center, the prisoner, who was later transferred from the center to another state correctional facility at which he was not treated involuntarily with antipsychotic drugs, filed suit in state court under 42 USCS 1983 against various individuals and the state, claiming that the failure to provide a judicial hearing before the involuntary administration of antipsychotic drugs violated the due process provisions of the Federal Constitution. After the trial court held that the procedures contained in the center's policy met the requirements of due process, the Washington Supreme Court, on appeal, reversed and remanded the case to the trial court, holding that under the Fourteenth Amendment's due process clause, the state could administer antipsychotic drugs to a competent, nonconsenting prisoner only after a judicial hearing at which the state had proved that the administration of the drugs was both necessary and effective for furthering a compelling state interest (110 Wash 2d 873, 759 P2d 358).",lexis

"A retail store was located in a shopping plaza within the metropolitan area of Hartford, Connecticut. All of the store's 200 employees lived in the Hartford metropolitan area; none of them lived on the store owner's property. The store owner was a joint owner of the shopping plaza's parking lot, which was separated from a public highway by a 46-foot-wide grassy strip, almost all of which was public property. In a campaign to organize the store employees, a union inserted a full-page advertisement in a Hartford newspaper, but the advertisement drew little response. Subsequently, union organizers who were not store employees entered the parking lot and placed handbills on the windshields of cars parked in a corner of the lot that was used mostly by the store employees. Each time this occurred, store personnel asked the organizers to leave and the handbills were removed. The organizers relocated to the grassy strip, from where they displayed picket signs over a period of 7 months. The organizers were able to secure the names and addresses of 41 employees, approximately 20 percent of the total. The union sent four mailings to these employees and made some attempts to contact them by phone or by home visits. These efforts resulted in only one signed union authorization card. Alleging that the store owner had violated 8(a)(1) of the National Labor Relations Act (NLRA) (29 USCS 158(a)(1)) by barring the organizers from the parking lot, the union filed an unfair labor practice charge with the National Labor Relations Board (NLRB). An administrative law judge ruled in the union's favor. The NLRB, affirming, (1) applied a standard under which (a) the employees' rights under 7 of the NLRA (29 USCS 157)--which guarantees employees the right of self-organization--were balanced against the store owner's property rights, and (b) the availability of reasonably effective alternative means of communication was considered; (2) found that the union had no such alternative means available; and (3) held that the store owner was required by 7 to grant access to the organizers.

A motion-picture version of the story was produced and distributed in 1954, during the initial term, by producers who were the original production company's successors in interest. In 1968, before the commencement of the renewal period, the story's author died without having obtained the rights in the renewal term for the motion picture's producers. In 1969, the author's executor and statutory successor renewed the copyright in the story and assigned the renewal rights not to the producers, but to a literary agent. When the motion picture was subsequently rereleased in a variety of media in 1971 and thereafter, the literary agent brought a copyright infringement suit in the United States District Court for the Central District of California against the producers and other owners of rights in the motion picture. The literary agent claimed that the rerelease of the motion picture interfered with his plans to produce other works derived from the story. The District Court, granting summary judgment in favor of the motion-picture owners, (1) invoked a United States Court of Appeals for the Second Circuit decision to the effect that the owner of a copyright in a derivative work may properly continue to use the existing derivative work according to the original grant from the author of the pre-existing work, even if the grant of rights in the pre-existing work lapsed, and (2) held that the rerelease of the motion picture was permitted as ""fair use"" under 107 of the Copyright Act of 1976 (17 USCS 107). The United States Court of Appeals for the Ninth Circuit, reversing on appeal, held that (1) the motion-picture owners had received from the story's author only an expectancy in the renewal rights, which expectancy had never matured, and (2) the rerelease of the motion picture was not ""fair use"" under 107 (863 F2d 1465).",lexis

"The United States Forest Service planned to complete a 75-mile road between two California towns by building a 6-mile connecting segment through an area within a National Forest. The area had historically been used by members of three Indian tribes to conduct a wide variety of specific religious rituals for the purpose of personal spiritual development. A study commissioned by the Forest Service found that specific sites within the area were used for certain rituals, and that the area as a whole had religious significance to the Indians. According to the study, successful religious use of the area depended on privacy, silence, and an undisturbed natural setting, and constructing a road along any of the available routes would cause serious and irreparable damage to the sanctity of the area. Nevertheless, the Forest Service decided to proceed with the construction, and a route was selected that avoided archeological sites and was removed as far as possible from the sites used by contemporary Indians for specific spiritual activities. The Forest Service also adopted a plan allowing for the harvesting of timber in the area, with one-half-mile protective zones around the specific religious sites. An Indian organization, individual Indians, and others challenged both the road-building and the timber-harvesting decisions in the United States District Court for the Northern District of California. The District Court, finding that both decisions violated the free exercise of religion clause of the Federal Constitution's First Amendment, the Federal Water Pollution Control Act (FWPCA) (33 USCS 1251 et seq.), and the National Environment Policy Act of 1969 (NEPA) (42 USCS 4321 et seq.), issued an injunction forbidding timber harvesting or road building in a large tract of the forest unless and until compliance with the FWPCA and the NEPA were demonstrated, and permanently enjoined timber harvesting and road building in the smaller area affected by the First Amendment challenge (565 F Supp 586). While an appeal was pending, Congress enacted a statute under which commercial activities, including timber harvesting, were forbidden in the area except for the proposed road route itself. The United States Court of Appeals for the Ninth Circuit affirmed the District Court's decision in pertinent part, concluding that the Government had failed to demonstrate a compelling interest in the completion of the road (795 F2d 688).",lexis

When the state welfare agency terminated AFDC and medical benefits payable to them on the child's behalf and instituted proceedings to reduce the level of food stamps that their household was receiving, the recipients brought an action in the United States District Court for the Middle District of Pennsylvania against the state welfare agency, the Secretary of Health and Human Services, and the Secretary of Agriculture, arguing that the free exercise clause of the First Amendment to the Federal Constitution entitled them to an exemption from the social security number requirement, and requesting injunctive relief, damages, and benefits. When it was disclosed at the trial that a social security number had been assigned to the child, the government suggested that the case was moot, but the court held that the case was not moot because of the father's belief that widespread use of the number by the government would ""rob the spirit"" of his daughter. The court permanently restrained the Secretary of Health and Human Services from using and disseminating the number issued in the child's name and enjoined the federal and state defendants until the child's 16th birthday from denying the recipients benefits because of their refusal to provide a social security number for the child; the court, however, denied the request for damages and benefits (590 F Supp 600).",lexis
"The Adolescent Family Life Act (42 USCS 300z et seq.), adopted in 1981, is a scheme for providing grants to public or nonprofit private organizations or agencies for services and research in the area of premarital adolescent sexual relations and pregnancy. Grant recipients are to provide services for the care of pregnant adolescents and adolescent parents ( 300z-1(a)(7)) and the prevention of adolescent sexual relations ( 300z-1(a)(8)). The Act states that such services should promote the involvement of parents and other family members, religious and charitable organizations, voluntary associations, and other groups ( 300z(a)(10)(C)), and grant applicants are required to describe how they will involve such individuals and groups ( 300z-5(a)(21)). Among the services that may be funded are counseling and educational services ( 300z-1(a)(4)). The Act imposes limitations on the use of grant funds for family planning services ( 300z-3(b)(1)) and forbids grants to projects or programs that advocate, promote, or encourage abortion ( 300z-10(a)). There is no express provision in the Act preventing the use of federal funds for religious purposes, but a 1984 Senate report on the Act stated that such a use of funds would be contrary to the intent of the Act.

These parties, seeking declaratory and injunctive relief, claimed that the Act, on its face and as applied, violated the establishment of religion clause of the Federal Constitution's First Amendment. The District Court held that (1) although the Act had a valid secular purpose, it was unconstitutional on its face because it had the direct and immediate effect of advancing religion insofar as religious organizations were involved in carrying out the programs and purposes of the Act, and (2) the Act was unconstitutional as applied, because funds had been provided to ""pervasively sectarian"" institutions, with the effect of directly advancing religion and leading to entanglement of church and state (657 F Supp 1547).",lexis

"The parents of a deaf student in Pima County, Arizona, asked a public school district in the county to provide a sign-language interpreter to accompany the student to classes in a Roman Catholic sectarian high school. The school district petitioned the county attorney for an opinion on the constitutionality of providing such a service; the deputy county attorney subsequently advised that providing an interpreter on the school's premises would violate the Federal Constitution. The question was next referred to the Arizona attorney general, who concurred in the deputy county attorney's opinion. The student and his parents instituted an action against the school district in the United States District Court for the District of Arizona under a provision of the Individuals with Disabilities Education Act (IDEA) (20 USCS 1415(e)(4)(A)). Seeking injunctive relief and reimbursement for the cost of hiring an interpreter at their own expense, the student and his parents asserted, among other things, that the IDEA (20 USCS 1400 et seq.) required the school district to provide the student with an interpreter, and that such relief was not barred by the establishment of religion clause of the Federal Constitution's First Amendment. For purposes of the litigation, the parties did not dispute that (1) sign-language interpretation was a service to which the student was entitled pursuant to federal regulations promulgated under the IDEA, and (2) the school district would have paid for an interpreter if the student had attended a public school or a nonreligious private school. The District Court ultimately granted the school district's motion for summary judgment, on the ground that furnishing an interpreter in the sectarian school would promote the student's religious development at government expense and would thus involve the entanglement of church and state in violation of the establishment of religion clause. The United States Court of Appeals for the Ninth Circuit, in affirming on appeal, expressed the view that the IDEA, if applied as proposed, would have the primary effect of advancing religion and thus would violate the establishment of religion clause (963 F2d 1190).",lexis

The U.S. Supreme Court unanimously held that the defendants' sentences were proper since ¬¨√ü 924(c) required the highest mandatory minimum specified for the defendants' conduct in ¬¨√ü 924(c), unless another provision of law, specifically directed to conduct proscribed by ¬¨√ü 924(c), imposed an even greater mandatory minimum. In determining whether a greater minimum sentence was otherwise provided by any other provision of law, the key question was whether other law provided for the conduct ¬¨√ü 924(c) proscribed, i.e., possessing a firearm in connection with a predicate crime. Rather than implausibly limiting sentences, the ""except"" clause was intended to insure that violators of ¬¨√ü 924(c) served at least five years.",lexis

"The employee filed a union grievance challenging his termination as chief of police. After the employee's reinstatement, the council issued 11 directives. The employee claimed that his union grievance and lawsuit were petitions protected by the Petition Clause of the First Amendment, and the directives and denial of overtime were retaliation for those protected activities. The Court determined that the employee, to show that petitioners interfered with rights under the Petition Clause, had to show that his petitions related to a matter of public concern. The public concern test limited Petition Clause claims by public employees because, inter alia, (1) a substantial overlap between the rights of speech and petition existed to justify the application of Speech Clause precedents to Petition Clause claims, (2) the history and purpose of the Petition Clause did not justify the imposition of broader liability when an employee invoked its protection instead of the protection afforded by the Speech Clause, and (3) unrestrained application of the Petition Clause in the context of government employment would subject a wide range of government operations to invasive judicial superintendence.",lexis
"Under Miranda v Arizona (1966) 384 US 436, 16 L Ed 2d 694, 86 S Ct 1602, 10 ALR3d 974, a person who is in custody is entitled to certain warnings before being interrogated by law enforcement officers. An ice cream truck driver, who was not considered by a county sheriff's office detective to be a leading suspect in the detective's homicide investigation concerning the death of a 10-year-old girl, was taken at the detective's request to a police station for questioning as a potential witness in the investigation. While being questioned at the station by the detective, the driver, who had not been issued Miranda warnings by the detective or the other law enforcement officer who was present, said that he had used his housemate's turquoise American-made car on the night of the homicide. This statement aroused the detective's suspicion that the driver may have been involved in the homicide, because a car matching such a description had been implicated in the homicide. When the driver, in response to further questioning, admitted to prior convictions for rape, kidnapping, and child molestation, the detective terminated the questioning and another officer advised the driver of his Miranda rights. The driver declined to make further statements, requested an attorney, was arrested, and was charged with first-degree murder and other crimes. Concluding that the driver was not in custody and thus not entitled to Miranda warnings until the detective's suspicion focused on the driver as a result of the driver's mention of the turquoise car, a state trial court denied, in relevant part, the driver's motion to suppress all statements made at the police station and the evidence discovered as a result of those statements. The driver was convicted of first-degree murder and other crimes and was sentenced to death for the murder conviction. The Supreme Court of California, expressing the view that the driver was not subject to custodial interrogation until he aroused the detective's suspicion by mentioning the car, affirmed the judgment of the trial court (4 Cal 4th 1017, 17 Cal Rptr 2d 174, 846 P2d 756).",lexis

The District Court dismissed their complaint (292 F Supp 243).

"After an individual's 11-year-old stepdaughter had been murdered in Arizona, the individual, who was a suspect in the killing, was incarcerated in a federal prison for an unrelated federal crime. Eventually, the individual confessed to the murder to a fellow inmate who was a paid informant for the Federal Bureau of Investigation, after the informant had (1) become friends with the individual; (2) said that he--the informant--knew that the individual was starting to get some ""tough treatment"" from other inmates because of a rumor that the individual was suspected of the murder; and (3) offered to protect the individual from his fellow inmates. Prior to the individual's capital trial in the Superior Court, Maricopa County, Arizona, on a charge of first-degree murder, the individual, claiming that there had been a violation of his alleged rights to due process under the Federal Constitution's Fifth and Fourteenth Amendments, moved to suppress (1) his first confession to the informant; and (2) a second confession to a woman who eventually became the informant's wife. The trial court, however, in denying the motion to suppress, specifically found that both confessions had been voluntary. The state introduced both confessions as evidence at trial, and the individual was convicted of murder and sentenced to death. On appeal, the Arizona Supreme Court (1) initially affirmed, as the court expressed the view, with respect to the two confessions, that (a) even though the first confession had been coerced, the admission of the first confession at trial had been harmless error, and (b) the second confession had not been inadmissible as a ""fruit of the poisonous tree""; but (2) upon the individual's motin for reconsideration, reversed the individual's conviction and ordered that the individual be retried without the use of the first confession, on the ground that harmless-error analysis was inapplicable to coerced confessions (161 Ariz 237, 778 P2d 602).",lexis

A ""participant"" is defined in 29 USCS 1002(7) as any employee or former employee who is or may become eligible to receive a benefit from an employee benefit plan,"" and an ""employee"" is defined in 3(6) of ERISA (29 USCS 1002(6)) as ""any individual employed by an employer."" Contracts between an insurer and an insurance agent provided that (1) the agent, who operated an insurance agency, would sell only the insurer's policies, (2) the insurer would enroll the agent in the insurer's retirement plan for agents, and (3) the agent would forfeit his entitlement to plan benefits if, within a year of termination of the parties' contractual relationship, and within 25 miles of the agent's prior business location, he sold insurance for the insurer's competitors. One month after the contractual relationship was terminated, the agent began to sell insurance for the insurer's competitors. After the insurer contended that the agent's new business activities disqualified him from receiving plan benefits, the agent sued for the benefits under 1132(a) and claimed that the benefits were nonforfeitable because they had already vested under the terms of ERISA. Applying common-law agency principles, the United States District Court for the Eastern District of North Carolina granted summary judgment to the insurer on the ground that the agent had been an independent contractor rather than an employee of the insurer. Reversing and remanding, the United States Court of Appeals for the Fourth Circuit held that common-law agency principles were inapplicable and that an ERISA plaintiff could qualify as an employee by showing that he or she (1) had a reasonable expectation of receiving pension benefits, (2) relied on this expectation, and (3) lacked the economic power to contract out of benefit plan forfeiture provisions (796 F2d 701).

The 1965 Act was amended by its successor, the Public Health Cigarette Smoking Act of 1969 (the ""1969 Act"") (15 USCS 1331-1340, later amended), which, among other changes, replaced the original 5(b) with a new 5(b) (15 USCS 1334(b)), providing that no requirement or prohibition based on smoking and health would be imposed under ""State law"" with respect to the advertising and promotion of any cigarettes the packages of which were labeled in conformity with the provisions of the 1969 Act. In 1983, a husband and wife (1) filed a federal diversity action in the United States District Court for the District of New Jersey; (2) alleged that the wife, who had begun smoking in 1942, had developed lung cancer from smoking cigarettes manufactured and sold by three defendants; and (3) asserted numerous claims under New Jersey law, including claims to the effect that the defendants had (a) breached express warranties in their advertising, (b) failed to warn consumers about the hazards of smoking, (c) fraudulently misrepresented those hazards, and (d) conspired to deprive the public of information about smoking. The District Court, determining that the 1965 and 1969 Acts did not pre-empt state common-law actions, granted a motion to strike a pre-emption defense (593 F Supp 1146). On interlocutory appeal, the United States Court of Appeals for the Third Circuit, in reversing, relied on the statement of purpose in 1331, and concluded--without identifying which specific claims in the case were pre-empted--that state-law damages actions relating to smoking and health were pre-empted, where such actions challenged (1) the inadequacy of the warning on cigarette packages, or (2) the propriety of a party's actions with respect to the advertising and promotion of cigarettes (789 F2d 181). The United States Supreme Court denied certiorari (479 US 1043, 93 L Ed 2d 857, 107 S Ct 907). The case returned to the District Court, which ruled that the failure to warn, express warranty, fraudulent misrepresentation, and conspiracy claims were barred to the extent that those claims relied on post-1965 advertising, promotional, and public relations activities (649 F Supp 664). After a lengthy trial, the jury awarded $ 400,000 in damages, basically through rejecting the fraudulent misrepresentation and conspiracy claims, but accepting the failure to warn and express warranty claims for pre-1966 conduct.

The collector complied, cleaning his truck bin of other garbage before he collected the bags in question. Without a warrant, the investigator searched through the contents of those bags and found items indicative of narcotics use, which she then used in obtaining a warrant to search the individual's home where quantities of narcotics were found. A subsequent similar trash search produced further evidence supporting a second search of the house. The Superior Court of Orange County, California, however, dismissed charges against the individual and an alleged accomplice arising from these searches on the grounds (1) that under state precedent such a warrantless trash search violates the Fourth Amendment to the Federal Constitution and similar provisions of the state constitution, and (2) the police would not have had probable cause to search the home without the evidence obtained from the trash searches. In affirming the Superior Court's decision, the California Court of Appeal stated that, while a recent amendment to the state constitution had barred the suppression of evidence seized in violation of state law but not federal law, the state courts were bound by the aforementioned state precedent, holding that the trash search violated federal law, unless and until the United States Supreme Court decided the question differently (182 Cal App 3d 729, 227 Cal Rptr 539).

"Under the disability insurance benefits program of the Social Security Act, which conditions the continued receipt of benefits on the recipient's continuing to be disabled, a state agency charged with monitoring a benefit recipient's medical condition sent a questionnaire to the recipient. Although the recipient's response to the questionnaire indicated that his condition had not improved and identified medical sources from whom he had received treatment recently, the state agency, after considering information, including reports from the recipient's physician and a psychiatric consultant, informed the disability recipient that it had tentatively determined that his disability had ceased. In a written response to the letter which had included a statement of the reasons for the proposed termination and an advisement that the recipient might request reasonable time in which to obtain and submit additional information pertaining to his condition, the recipient disputed the characterization of his medical condition and indicated that the state agency already had enough evidence to establish his disability. Subsequently, the state agency made a final determination that disability had ceased, and the Social Security Administration, upon accepting such determination, notified the recipient that his benefits would terminate and advised him of his right to seek reconsideration by the state agency of the initial determination within six months. Declining to request reconsideration, the former recipient brought an action in the United States District Court for the Western District of Virginia, challenging the constitutionality of the administrative procedures established by the Secretary of Health, Education, and Welfare for assessing whether a continuing disability existed, and seeking an immediate reinstatement of benefits pending a hearing on the disability issue.

"The plaintiff, a cigarette manufacturer which was one of six firms which dominated the cigarette manufacturing industry, increased its declining share of the market by introducing a line of unbranded ""black and white"" generic cigarettes at a list price about 30 percent below those of branded cigarettes, as to which there had been no significant price competition. A large part of the plaintiff's market gains came at the expense of the defendant, another cigarette manufacturer, which responded by introducing its own black and whites and other discounted cigarettes, beating the first manufacturer's prices and volume discounts and by giving wholesalers larger rebates than the plaintiff gave, both initially and throughout an ensuing rebate war. The plaintiff, alleging trademark infringement and unfair competition, filed suit against the defendant in the United States District Court for the Middle District of North Carolina. The complaint was later amended to allege that the defendant's rebates to wholesalers violated 2(a) of the Clayton Act as amended by the Robinson-Patman Act (15 USCS 13(a)), because the rebates were integral to a supposed scheme of predatory price discrimination. The plaintiff's theory of competitive injury was that (1) the defendant entered the generic market with list prices matching the plaintiff's but with massive discriminatory rebates directed at the plaintiff's biggest wholesalers, (2) the net price paid by wholesalers for the defendant's generic cigarettes would drop below the defendant's cost, (3) the plaintiff would suffer losses trying to defend its market share and wholesale customer base by matching the defendant's rebates, (4) to avoid further losses, the plaintiff would raise its list prices on generics or acquiesce in price leadership by the defendant, (5) higher list prices to consumers would shrink the percentage gap in retail price between generic and branded cigarettes, and (6) this narrowing of the gap would make generics less appealing to consumers, thus slowing the growth of the economy cigarette market and reducing loss of sales of branded cigarettes and their associated supracompetitive prices. A jury returned a verdict in favor of the plaintiff on the price discrimination claim; but the District Court, after reviewing the record, ruled that the defendant was entitled to judgment notwithstanding the verdict, partly because (1) no slowing of the growth rate of generics, and thus no injury to competition, was possible unless there had been tacit coordination of prices among the various manufacturers in the economy cigarette market, and (2) a reasonable jury could only have found that there was no such coordination (748 F Supp 344).

At the defendant's subsequent trial before a jury in an Ohio Court of Common Pleas, the defendant, represented by new counsel, testified that the daughter had given him her parents' checkbook and credit cards with the understanding that he could use them. The daughter did not appear at trial, even though several subpoenas had been issued to her at her parents' residence during the previous year, and the state, pursuant to a state statute permitting the use of preliminary examination testimony of a witness who could not for any reason be produced at the trial, offered the transcript of her preliminary hearing testimony in rebuttal. The defendant objected to the use of the transcript, asserting a violation of the Sixth Amendment's confrontation clause. After conducting a voir dire hearing as to the transcript's admissibility at which the witness' mother testified--the mother testifying that the witness had left home soon after the preliminary hearing, that about a year before the trial, an out-of-state social worker communicated with her and the witness' father about a welfare application the witness had filed there, that through the social worker she and her husband had reached the daughter once by telephone, that the witness had since called home only one other time and had not been in touch with her two sisters, and that she knew of no way to reach the witness in case of emergency nor know of anybody who knew where the daughter was--the trial court admitted the transcript into evidence. The Court of Appeals of Ohio reversed, concluding that the prosecution had failed to make a showing of good-faith effort to secure the absent witness' attendance. On appeal, the Supreme Court of Ohio affirmed, ruling that the Court of Appeals erred in its conclusion, but holding that the transcript was inadmissible because the mere opportunity to cross-examine at a preliminary hearing did not afford constitutional confrontation for purposes of trial (55 Ohio St 2d 191, 378 NE2d 492).",lexis

The U.S. Supreme Court held, however, that the debtor was not entitled to the vehicle ownership expense since the debtor did not make any loan or lease payment for the vehicle. The debtor was only entitled to deduct applicable expenses, meaning expenses applicable to the debtor's financial circumstances, and the debtor had no applicable vehicle ownership expense since he had no loan or lease expense. Further, the debtor's interpretation that he could claim the standard expense even if he had no actual expense would have rendered the word ""applicable"" superfluous.

The driver got out of the car and walked away, and when the police arrived, the witness told them what he had seen and the police checked the car's registration. Without obtaining a warrant, the police went to the home of the registered owner of the car, gained entry, and found the owner lying in bed. The car owner was then arrested for operating a motor vehicle while under the influence of an intoxicant and taken to the police station where he refused to take a breathalyzer test. To avoid license revocation, the car owner requested a hearing on his refusal to take the test. The trial court concluded that the arrest was lawful and that the owner's refusal to take the test was unreasonable, and suspended his license. The suspension order was vacated by the Wisconsin Court of Appeals, which concluded that the warrantless arrest violated the Fourth Amendment because although the state had demonstrated probable cause to arrest, it had not established the existence of exigent circumstances. The Supreme Court of Wisconsin reversed the Court of Appeals, holding that there were exigent circumstances in the case--the need for hot pursuit of a suspect, the need to prevent physical harm to the offender and the public, and the need to prevent destruction of evidence (108 Wis 2d 319, 321 NW2d 245).",lexis

"Two cases presented the question whether the imposition of capital punishment on juvenile offenders constitutes cruel and unusual punishment prohibited by the Federal Constitution's Eighth Amendment. In one case, a boy who was then approximately 17 years and 4 months old allegedly robbed a gas station, raped and sodomized a station attendant, and finally shot the attendant to death so that she could not identify him. After the boy's arrest, the Jefferson District Court, Kentucky, determined that the boy should be tried as an adult in the Jefferson Circuit Court, Kentucky, as allowed by state law, in light of the seriousness of the offense and the unsuccessful attempts of the juvenile system to treat the boy for numerous instances of past delinquency. The boy was convicted of murder, first-degree sodomy, first-degree robbery, and receiving stolen property and was sentenced to death plus 45 years' imprisonment. The Supreme Court of Kentucky, in affirming the conviction and sentence, (1) rejected the boy's contention that he had a constitutional right to treatment, (2) ruled that the District Court had not erred in certifying the boy for trial as an adult, and (3) stated that the boy's age and the possibility of rehabilitation were mitigating factors properly left to the consideration of the jury (734 SW2d 781). In the second case, a boy who was then approximately 16 years and 6 months old allegedly conceived a plan to rob a convenience store--which plan involved murdering whoever was behind the counter so as to leave no witness--and, in executing that plan, repeatedly stabbed the store's owner/operator and left her to die. A Missouri juvenile court certified the boy for trial as an adult, based on the viciousness of the crime, the boy's maturity, and the failure of the juvenile justice system to rehabilitate him after previous delinquent acts. The boy was then charged with first-degree murder, armed criminal action, and carrying a concealed weapon, to which charges he pleaded guilty after a Missouri trial court found him competent and failed to dissuade him from waiving his rights. At a punishment hearing, (1) both the prosecution and the boy urged imposition of the death sentence, (2) expert witnesses testified that the boy had personality disorders but was aware of his actions and could distinguish right from wrong, and (3) the trial court found that the death penalty was appropriate, given the heinousness of the crime and the fact that it was committed in the course of a robbery. In affirming the boy's conviction and sentence, the Supreme Court of Missouri rejected arguments that the death sentence was disproportionate to the penalty imposed in other similar cases (736 SW2d 409).",lexis

The parents contended that the Vaccine Act did not preclude a claim that the vaccine was defectively designed. The U.S. Supreme Court held that the Vaccine Act preempted the parents' design-defect claim against the manufacturer seeking compensation for injury to the child allegedly caused by the vaccine's side effects. The design of the vaccine was not subject to question in a tort action since a vaccine side-effect could always be avoidable by use of a different vaccine not containing the harmful element, and what the Vaccine Act established as a complete defense was unavoidability, given safe manufacture and warning, with respect to the particular design. Further, although products-liability law established three grounds for liability--defective manufacture, inadequate warnings, and defective design--the Vaccine Act mentioned only manufacture and warnings, and the failure to mention design-defect liability was by deliberate choice, not inadvertence.",lexis
"During the course of negotiations between a union and a multi-employer bargaining association, the union struck and picketed the plant of one of the association members.

Both the strike and the lockout continued until successful conclusion of the contract negotiations, at which time the strike was ended and the laid-off employees were recalled. The union filed with the National Labor Relations Board an unfair labor practice charge against the employers who had instituted the lockout, alleging that such employers had violated the amended National Labor Relations Act by interfering with their employees' rights to self-organization, and by discriminating in regard to hire or tenure of employment in order to discourage union membership.

Such proceedings were conducted pursuant to Illinois statutes under which an unwed father is not included in the statutory definition of ""parent,"" and thus is subject to being deprived of the custody of his illegitimate children by dependency proceedings in which he is not entitled to a hearing as to his fitness as a parent but, in effect, is presumed to be unfit, whereas married or divorced parents or unwed mothers raising their children can be deprived of custody only through neglect proceedings wherein the parent is entitled to a hearing on fitness. On appeal by the unwed father, the Illinois Supreme Court rejected his contention that he had been deprived of equal protection under the Fourteenth Amendment since he had never been shown to be an unfit parent, and since other parents could not be deprived of their children without such a showing (45 Ill 2d 132, 256 NE2d 814).",lexis

The trial court sustained the state's objection to the defendant's going behind the warrant affidavit and denied the motion to suppress. After the defendant was convicted at a trial at which evidence obtained on the challenged search was admitted, the defendant appealed, and the Supreme Court of Delaware affirmed, holding that a defendant under no circumstances could challenge, subsequent to the ex parte issuance of a search warrant, the veracity of a sworn statement used by police to procure the search warrant (373 A2d 578).",lexis

A Florida lawyer and his wholly owned lawyer referral service, challenging the rules, filed an action for declaratory and injunctive relief against the Florida Bar in the United States District Court for the Middle District of Florida. The District Court, rejecting the report and recommendations of a United States Magistrate Judge, (1) expressed the view that the rules violated the Federal Constitution's First, Fifth, and Fourteenth Amendments, as the rules (a) were not justified by a government interest in preventing undue influence, intimidation, and overreaching by lawyers, (b) were not narrowly tailored in a manner that advanced the asserted government interest, (c) did not constitute a valid time, place, and manner restriction, and (d) substantially impaired the availability of truthful and relevant information as to legal services; and (2) entered summary judgment for the referral service and a lawyer who had been substituted for the service's owner (808 F Supp 1543).

"Police dispatched to a gas station parking lot found the victim mortally wounded. He told them that he had been shot by defendant outside defendant's house and had then driven himself to the lot. The officers testified at trial about what the victim had told them. The victim was unavailable at trial because he had died shortly after the shooting. What the victim told the officers was that he fled the shooter's back porch, indicating that he perceived an ongoing threat. The police did not know, and the victim did not tell them, whether the threat was limited to him. The informality of the exchange suggested that the officers' purpose was to address what they perceived to be an ongoing emergency. The circumstances lacked any formality that would have alerted the victim to or focused him on the possible future prosecutorial use of his statements.

There was no basis for the State's argument that a defendant who committed some act of wrongdoing that rendered a witness unavailable forfeited his right to object to the witness's testimony on confrontation grounds, but not on hearsay grounds.

"Under 28 USCS 1441(b), any suit filed in a state court is removable to a Federal District Court, without regard to the citizenship or residence of the parties, if the District Court would have had original jurisdiction over the suit as a civil action founded on a claim or right arising under the Constitution, treaties, or laws of the United States. Two families residing in Canada and Scotland, respectively, filed suits in the Court of Common Pleas of Hamilton County, Ohio, against the corporation which manufactured and distributed a drug. Each complaint alleged that a child was born with multiple deformities as a result of the mother's ingestion of the drug during pregnancy. In each complaint, five of the six counts asserted various state common-law theories, while the sixth count claimed that (1) the drug was misbranded in violation of the Federal Food, Drug, and Cosmetic Act (FDCA) (21 USCS 301 et seq.) because the drug's label did not provide adequate warning of dangerousness, and (2) this violation in the promotion of the drug constituted negligence which proximately caused the injuries suffered. Under 1441(b), the corporation filed a timely petition for removal to a District Court. The two cases were consolidated, and the District Court (1) held that the drug-misbranding count of each complaint alleged a cause of action under federal law; (2) denied a motion to remand the litigation to the Ohio court; and (3) granted the corporation's motion to dismiss the litigation on forum non conveniens grounds. On appeal, the United States Court of Appeals for the Sixth Circuit reversed, expressing the view that (1) the parties agreed that the FDCA did not create or imply a federal private right of action for individuals injured as a result of a violation of the FDCA; (2) the plaintiffs' causes of action therefore did not necessarily depend on a question of federal law; (3) the causes of action consequently did not arise under federal law; and (4) the causes of action were therefore improperly removed to federal court and ought to be remanded to the Court of Common Pleas (766 F2d 1005).",lexis

"A union and a corporation entered into a master collective bargaining agreement covering terms and conditions of employment at several of the corporation's plants. Among other things, the agreement contained an affirmative action plan designed to eliminate conspicuous racial imbalances in the corporation's almost exclusively white craft work force. After setting black craft hiring goals for each plant equal to the percentage of blacks in the respective local labor forces, the plan established on-the-job training programs to teach unskilled production workers the skills necessary to become craft workers. At one particular plant, where the craft work force was less than 2% black even though the local work force was 39% black, the corporation established a training program and selected trainees on the basis of seniority, with the proviso that at least 50% of the new trainees were to be black until the percentage of black skilled craft workers in the plant approximated the percentage of blacks in the local labor force. During the plan's first year of operation, the most junior black trainee selected had less seniority than several white production workers whose bids for admission to the program were rejected.

"A local waste-disposal company brought an action in the United States District Court for the District of Vermont, alleging that a nationwide waste-disposal company had violated federal antitrust law by attempting to monopolize a particular segment of the local waste-disposal market, and had interfered with the local company's contractual relations in violation of Vermont tort law. After a jury found the nationwide company liable on both counts and awarded the local company $ 51,146 in compensatory damages on both the federal and state-law claims, and $ 6 million in punitive damages on the state-law claim, the District Court denied the nationwide company's motion for judgment notwithstanding the verdict, a new trial, or remittitur. On appeal, the United States Court of Appeals for the Second Circuit, affirming the judgment both as to liability and as to damages, expressed the view that, even if the Federal Constitution's Eighth Amendment, which includes a prohibition against excessive fines, were applicable to the case, the punitive damages were not so disproportionate as to be constitutionally excessive (845 F2d 404).",lexis

"The officials contended that _ 1973 required the officials to draw the election district lines to allow a racial minority to join with other voters to elect the minority's candidate of choice, even where the racial minority was less than 50 percent of the voting-age population in the district to be drawn. In a plurality opinion, the U.S. Supreme Court held that, to satisfy the requirement for a claim of vote dilution under _ 1973 that the minority be sufficiently large to constitute a majority in a single-member district, the minority was required to constitute more that 50 percent of the voting population in the relevant area. Section 1973 did not authorize special protection to the minority's right to form political coalitions where minority voters could not elect their candidate of choice based on their own votes and without assistance from others.

"Pursuant to a property settlement agreement executed prior to divorce, a Delaware taxpayer transferred to his wife shares of stock having at the time a market value of $ 82,250, the taxpayer's cost basis for the stock being $ 74,775.37. He also paid $ 5,000 for tax advice in relation to the property settlement, one-half of which went to his wife's attorney. The Commissioner of Internal Revenue ruled that (1) one-half of the appreciation in value of the stock, or $ 3,737.31, was includible in the husband's gross income as a net long-term capital gain, and (2) the fees paid to the wife's attorney were not deductible. The taxpayer sued in the Court of Claims to recover for an alleged overpayment of taxes based on the Commissioner's rulings. The Court of Claims upset the Commissioner's determination as to (1), reasoning that the gain could not be determined because of the impossibility of evaluating the fair market value of the wife's inchoate marital rights, and upheld the Commissioner's ruling as to (2).

"A motorist who had allegedly driven his automobile across the double yellow line on a New York highway and struck two oncoming vehicles, and who had been found later that evening to have a blood alcohol level of .19 percent, was served with traffic tickets charging him with (1) driving while intoxicated, and (2) failing to keep right of the median. The driver of one of the other vehicles died the same day, and her husband, a passenger, was seriously injured. Three days later, an assistant district attorney began gathering evidence for a homicide prosecution in connection with the accident, but he did not attempt to learn when the motorist was scheduled to appear in town justice court on the traffic charges, nor did he inform either the justice court, or the assistant district attorney covering that court, about the investigation. The motorist pleaded guilty to the traffic tickets in the justice court 14 days after the accident, with no member of the district attorney's office present, and the presiding judge, who was unaware of the other driver's death, accepted the pleas. At a sentencing hearing 3 weeks later, in the presence of an assistant district attorney who was also unaware of the fatality and had not been able to locate the case file but did not seek an adjournment, the judge fined the motorist and temporarily revoked his driver's license. Two months after the sentencing hearing, a grand jury indicted the motorist for, among other things, reckless manslaughter, criminally negligent homicide, and reckless assault, and the prosecution filed a bill of particulars which indicated that the reckless or negligent acts it would rely on in proving those charges were (1) driving while intoxicated, (2) failing to keep right of the median, and (3) driving at a speed that was too fast for the weather and road conditions at the time of the accident.

"Two companies operated salmon canneries in remote areas of Alaska, which canneries functioned only during the summer salmon runs. There were two general types of jobs at the canneries: cannery line jobs, which were unskilled positions, and ""noncannery"" jobs, which were predominantly skilled positions but varied from engineers and bookkeepers to cooks and boat crew members. The cannery workers were predominantly nonwhite, mainly Filipinos, whom the companies hired through a hiring hall agreement with a predominantly Filipino union local in Seattle, and Alaska Natives, hired from villages near the canneries. The noncannery workers were predominantly white and were hired during the winter through the companies' offices in Washington and Oregon. Virtually all of the noncannery jobs paid more than the cannery jobs, and noncannery workers used dormitory and mess hall facilities which were separate from and allegedly superior to those of the cannery workers. A class of nonwhite cannery workers who were or had been employed at the canneries in question brought an action against the companies in the United States District Court for the Western District of Washington, which action charged the companies with employment discrimination on the basis of race in violation of a provision of Title VII of the Civil Rights Act of 1964 (42 USCS 2000e-2(a)). Specifically, it was alleged that the racial stratification of the work force was caused by several of the companies' hiring and promotion practices, including a rehire preference, a lack of objective hiring criteria, the separate hiring channels, and a practice of not promoting from within. After a trial, the District Court ruled in favor of the companies, as it (1) rejected the class' claims of intentional discrimination or ""disparate treatment,"" (2) held that subjective employment criteria were not subject to challenge on a disparate-impact theory, and (3) found that the class had failed to prove disparate impact with regard to other practices. A panel of the United States Court of Appeals for the Ninth Circuit affirmed (768 F2d 1120); but the Court of Appeals en banc vacated the panel's decision, as it held that (1) disparate-impact analysis can be applied to subjective employment practices, and (2) once the plaintiff has shown disparate impact caused by specific practices, the burden shifts to the employer to prove the business necessity of those practices (810 F2d 1477). On remand, the panel (1) determined that the plaintiff class had made out a prima facie case of disparate impact in hiring for noncannery positions, based on statistical evidence of racial stratification by job category, and accordingly (2) vacated the District Court judgment and remanded the case for an evaluation of the business necessity of practices causally linked to that stratification (827 F2d 439).",lexis
"During most of 1978 a taxpayer (1) devoted 60-80 hours a week on gambling-related endeavors; (2) gambled solely for his own account; (3) had no other profession or type of employment; and (4) won $ 70,000, but bet $ 72,032, for a net gambling loss of $ 2,032. As applicable to federal income taxes for 1978, (1) 56(a) of the Internal Revenue Code of 1954 (later redesignated) (26 USCS 56(a)) imposed a minimum tax on items of tax preference, but (2) pursuant to 57(a)(1), 57(b)(1)(A), and 62(1) of the Code (later amended) (26 USCS 57(a)(1), 57(b)(1)(A), 62(1)), such tax preference items did not, in effect, include deductions attributable to a ""trade or business"" carried on by a taxpayer. The Commissioner of Internal Revenue determined that a portion of the taxpayer's 1978 gambling losses constituted an item of tax preference, and assessed a minimum tax accordingly. The taxpayer sought a redetermination of the deficiency in the United States Tax Court, which found that (1) the 1982 statutory amendments to the minimum tax provisions, which expressly exempted gambling losses from the minimum tax, did not have any relevance to the issue before the court; (2) under an examination of all the facts in the case, the taxpayer's gambling activities were sufficiently regular, frequent, active, and substantial to constitute a trade or business; and (3) as a consequence, no part of the taxpayer's gambling losses constituted an item of tax preference in determining any minimum tax for 1978 (82 TC 793). On appeal, the United States Court of Appeals for the Seventh Circuit affirmed, expressing the view (771 F2d 269) that (1) the meaning of the term ""trade or business"" was the same under 62(1) and 162(a) of the Code (26 USCS 62(1), 162(a)), where both sections involved the deductability of expenses incurred in carrying on a trade or business; (2) the 1982 amendments to the minimum tax provisions provided no guidance for the case at hand; (3) the inquiry as to ""trade or business"" ought to concentrate on whether, under the facts and circumstances, certain activities of a taxpayer could be characterized as a livelihood, occupation, or means of earning a living; and (4) the taxpayer in this case met the test for 1978, where the Tax Court had found that the taxpayer had devoted a continuous and extraordinary amount of time to gambling efforts, with the intent to earn a living from this activity.",lexis
"In 1989, a Kentucky resident who was injured while operating a bulldozer filed, in Kentucky state court, a suit asserting state-law claims against the manufacturer of the bulldozer--a Delaware corporation with its principal place of business in Illinois--and the company that serviced the bulldozer, a Kentucky corporation with its principal place of business in Kentucky. In 1990, after the plaintiff had entered into a settlement agreement with the servicer, the manufacturer filed a notice of removal in the United States District Court for the Eastern District of Kentucky, in which notice it was asserted that the settlement had created complete diversity of citizenship so as to produce federal jurisdiction under 28 USCS 1332(a) and to render the case removable. The plaintiff, in objecting to the removal and in moving to remand the case to state court, argued that (1) an insurance company--which had intervened in the lawsuit to assert subrogation claims against the servicer and the manufacturer--had not yet settled its claim against the servicer, and (2) complete diversity was thus lacking. The District Court, without addressing this argument, denied the plaintiff's motion to remand. In 1993, the insurance company and the servicer entered into a settlement of the subrogation claim, and the District Court dismissed the servicer from the lawsuit. With the manufacturer as the sole defendant adverse to the plaintiff, the case proceeded to trial, and the District Court entered judgment for the manufacturer. On appeal, the United States Court of Appeals for the Sixth Circuit vacated the judgment, on the grounds that (1) diversity had not been complete at the time of removal, as the servicer had remained a defendant in the case due to the insurance company's subrogation claim; and (2) the District Court had thus erred in denying the plaintiff's motion to remand.",lexis
"Section 7(a)(2) of the Endangered Species Act (ESA) (16 USCS 1536(a)(2)) requires each federal agency to consult with the United States Secretary of the Interior to insure that any action authorized, funded, or carried out by such agency is not likely to jeopardize the continued existence of any endangered or threatened species. In 1978, the Fish and Wildlife Service and the National Marine Fisheries Service, on behalf of the Secretary of the Interior and the Secretary of Commerce respectively, promulgated a joint regulation stating that the obligations imposed by 7(a)(2) extended to actions taken in foreign nations. However, a revised joint regulation ( 50 CFR 402.01), promulgated in 1986, reinterpreted 7(a)(2) to require consultation only for actions taken in the United States or on the high seas. Organizations dedicated to wildlife conservation and other environmental causes filed an action against the Secretary of the Interior in the United States District Court for the District of Minnesota to seek (1) a declaratory judgment that the regulation was in error as to the geographical scope of 7(a)(2), and (2) an injunction requiring the Secretary to promulgate a new regulation restoring the initial interpretation. The District Court granted the Secretary's motion to dismiss for lack of standing (658 F Supp 43). On appeal, the United States Court of Appeals reversed and remanded (851 F2d 1035).

"The Foreign Sovereign Immunities Act of 1976 (FSIA) (28 USCS 1330, 1602 et seq.), which generally grants foreign states and their instrumentalities immunity from suit in the courts of the United States, is subject to an exception in the first clause of 28 USCS 1605(a)(2), to the effect that a foreign state is not immune from a suit in which the action is ""based upon a commercial activity carried on in the United States"" by the foreign state. The FSIA, in 28 USCS 1603(d), provides that the commercial character of an activity is to be determined by reference to its nature, rather than its purpose. A husband and wife filed a personal-injury damages action in the United States District Court for the Southern District of Florida against the Kingdom of Saudi Arabia, a Saudi hospital operated by the Kingdom, and the hospital's corporate purchasing agent in the United States, and alleged that (1) the husband had been recruited in the United States for employment at the hospital; (2) during orientation, the purchasing agent had been identified as the United States point of contact for family members who might want to reach the husband in an emergency; and (3) after the husband, while employed as a hospital safety monitor, had advised the hospital and the Saudi government of safety defects, the husband had been summoned to the hospital's security office and arrested by Saudi government agents, who had detained him in a jail cell and had tortured him. The complaint also alleged that (1) the defendants, in retaliation for the husband's reporting of safety defects, had committed intentional torts including battery, unlawful detainment, wrongful arrest and imprisonment, false imprisonment, inhuman torture, disruption of normal family life, and infliction of mental anguish; (2) the defendants had negligently failed to warn the husband of otherwise undisclosed dangers of employment, that is, the likelihood of such retaliation; and (3) the wife had sustained derivative injury from these acts. The District Court, however, in granting a defense motion to dismiss for lack of subject matter jurisdiction, rejected the argument that jurisdiction existed under the first clause of 1605(a)(2), as the court reasoned that (1) with respect to the Kingdom and the hospital, the recruitment of the husband in the United States did not amount to commercial activity carried on in the United States for purposes of the FSIA, for there was no sufficient nexus between the recruitment and the injuries alleged; and (2) the purchasing agent's commercial activity in the United States likewise had no nexus with the injuries alleged. On appeal, the United States Court of Appeals for the Eleventh Circuit, in reversing and in ordering a remand, expressed the view that, for purposes of the 1605(a)(2) exception, (1) the husband's recruitment and hiring were commercial activities of the Kingdom and the hospital carried on in the United States; (2) the action by the husband and wife was based upon these activities; and (3) there was also jurisdiction to hear the claims against the purchasing agent (923 F2d 1528).

The plaintiffs alleged that (1) its members used the forests, streams, and other resources in the area for camping, hiking, fishing, and sightseeing, (2) such use was directly disturbed by the adverse environmental impact caused by the nonuse of recyclable goods brought about by the surcharge on such goods, thereby encouraging increased use of nonrecyclable goods, and (3) the Commission's orders refusing to suspend the surcharge were unlawful because of its failure to include an environmental impact statement as required by 102(2)(C) of the National Environmental Policy Act of 1969, requiring such a statement as to major federal actions significantly affecting the quality of the human environment.

For some time after the 1981 issuance by then President Reagan of Executive Order No. 12324 (note following 8 USCS 1182), the United States had a policy that Coast Guard cutters would interdict on the high seas Haitians who attempted to emigrate by ship to the United States, with a screening process aboard the cutters, whereby aliens who were identified as economic migrants were repatriated to Haiti, but aliens who made a credible showing of political refugee status were transported to the United States to file formal applications for asylum. When a 1991 coup in Haiti was followed by widespread violence there, however, the number of Haitian emigrants--many in unseaworthy craft--increased dramatically. The United States then developed its interdiction policy whereby (1) Haitians were placed in temporary facilities at the United States Naval Base in Guantanamo, Cuba; and (2) a modified screening process was used. In March 1992, organizations that represented interdicted Haitians, as well as some detained Haitians, filed suit against several federal officials in the United States District Court for the Eastern District of New York and alleged that the screening procedures were inadequate. Meanwhile, both the available Coast Guard cutters and the Guantanamo facilities became saturated. In May 1992, then President Bush promulgated Executive Order No. 12807 (note following 8 USCS 1182), which generally directed the Coast Guard to intercept on the high seas vessels illegally transporting passengers from Haiti to the United States and to return those passengers to Haiti without first determining whether they might qualify as refugees. A press release issued contemporaneously with Executive Order No. 12807 (1) urged any Haitians who feared persecution to avail themselves of a refugee processing service at the American Embassy in Haiti; and (2) indicated that the American Embassy staff in Haiti would be increased for refugee processing if necessary. The District Court plaintiffs applied for a temporary restraining order and alleged that the Executive Order violated 243(h) and Article 33. The District Court, however, in denying the application, expressed the view that (1) 243(h) was unavailable as a source of relief for Haitian aliens in international waters; and (2) the Protocol's provisions were not self-executing. On appeal, the United States Court of Appeals for the Second Circuit, in reversing and in ordering a remand, expressed the view that (1) the plain language of 243(h) stated that the United States could not return aliens to their persecutors, no matter where in the world those actions were taken; and (2) while that conclusion made arguments concerning the self-executing nature of Article 33 largely academic, Article 33 applied to all refugees, just as 243(h) applied to all aliens, no matter where found (969 F2d 1350).

Following an evidentiary hearing, the court issued an amended permanent injunction which prohibited the protesters, and all persons acting ""in concert"" with them, from (1) ""congregating, picketing, patrolling, demonstrating, or entering,"" apart from specified exceptions, the public right-of-way ""or private property"" within a 36-foot buffer zone around the property line of the clinic; (2) singing, chanting, whistling, shouting, yelling, or using bullhorns, auto horns, sound amplification equipment, or other sounds to, or within earshot of, patients inside the clinic during specified hours; (3) using ""images observable"" to patients during such hours; (4) physically approaching, within 300 feet of the clinic, any person seeking clinic services, unless such person indicated a desire to communicate; and (5) approaching, congregating, picketing, patrolling, demonstrating, for using bullhorns or other sound amplification equipment within 300 feet of the residences of clinic staff, or obstructing the entrances, exits, or driveways of such residences, or impeding access to streets that provided the sole access to streets on which such residences were located.

In order to resolve the conflict between the Eleventh Circuit Court of Appeals decision and the Florida Supreme Court decision, the United States Supreme Court granted certiorari to review the Florida Supreme Court decision (510 US ____, 127 L Ed 2d 98, 114 S Ct 907).",lexis
"A self-employed farmer and carpenter who was a member of the Old Order Amish religion sued in the United States District Court for the Western District of Pennsylvania for a refund of the social security taxes paid by him pursuant to 26 USCS 3101 et seq. on account of his employment of other members of that religion on his farm and in his carpentry shop. He claimed that imposition of the taxes violated his First Amendment free exercise rights and those of his employees, because members of the Old Order Amish religion believe that there is a religiously based obligation to provide for their fellow members the kind of assistance contemplated by the social security system, and that therefore their religion prohibits acceptance of social security benefits and payment of social security taxes. The District Court held the statutes requiring the claimant to pay social security taxes unconstitutional as applied on the basis of both an exemption provided in 26 USCS 1402(g) for self-employed persons who conscientiously oppose acceptance of social security benefits and the First Amendment.",lexis
"A physician who was a native and citizen of Ghana overstayed a student visa that authorized him to remain in the United States until 1976. In 1981, he pleaded guilty to charges of attempting to obtain narcotic drugs by fraud. Deportation proceedings were initiated, and the immigration judge continued the hearing until April 1982 to give the physician an opportunity to apply for asylum. The physician expressly declined to do so, arguing instead that his marriage to a United States citizen made him eligible for an adjustment of status. The immigration judge denied the adjustment of status application and, in July 1982, ordered the physician deported. The Board of Immigration Appeals (BIA) dismissed his appeal in August 1984. In 1985, the physician filed a motion with the BIA requesting a reopening of the deportation proceeding to enable him to apply for asylum and a withholding of deportation. In this motion, the physician claimed that he had a well-founded fear that if he were returned to Ghana, his life and freedom would be threatened by the regime in power. He alleged that (1) his brother and certain close friends were among the targets of a campaign of persecution carried out by the government of Ghana after it seized power in 1981, and (2) a surprise visit in 1984 by a former acquaintance who had become a high official in the Ghana government and who invited the physician to return to Ghana, ostensibly because qualified physicians were in short supply, was actually an attempt to entice him to return in order to force him to disclose the whereabouts of his brother and other enemies of the government. The BIA denied the motion to reopen, on the grounds that the physician had not reasonably explained his failure to request asylum prior to the completion of the deportation proceedings, as required by Immigration and Naturalization Service regulations ( 8 CFR 3.2, 208.11). In so holding, the BIA noted that all of the facts set forth in the motion, except for the 1984 visit, had been available to the alien at the time of the initial proceeding, and that the visit might have been purely social in nature. The BIA also held that the facts set forth in the motion to reopen did not show either a clear probability of persecution within the meaning of 243(h) of the Immigration and Nationality Act (8 USCS 1253(h)), or that the physician was eligible for asylum as a refugee under 208 of the Act (8 USCS 1158). The United States Court of Appeals for the Ninth Circuit affirmed the original deportation order but reversed the order denying the motion to reopen, and remanded for an evidentiary hearing on the asylum and withholding of deportation claims. In so ruling, the Court of Appeals held that the physician had made out a prima facie case of well-founded fear of persecution. However, the Court of Appeals did not discuss, as a separate matter, the ""failure to explain"" ground in the BIA's decision (802 F2d 1096).",lexis
"The inmate drove a vehicle from which a co-defendant shot and killed a victim, but the inmate contended at trial that there was no evidence that the inmate was aware that the co-defendant intended to shoot the victim. The inmate argued that a jury instruction failed to clarify that the inmate must have knowledge of the murder, rather than any crime, in order to be convicted as an accomplice to the murder, in view of the prosecutor's argument that accomplice liability was premised on ""in for a dime, in for a dollar."" The U.S. Supreme Court held that the jury was properly instructed that, in order to find the inmate guilty as an accomplice, the inmate must have had knowledge that his conduct would promote or facilitate the commission of the murder. The instruction properly quoted the accomplice-liability statute, Wash. Rev. Code _ 9A.08.020 (2008), in requiring that the inmate have knowledge of the crime with which the inmate was charged as an accomplice. Further, there was no reasonable likelihood that the prosecutor's arguably improper closing statement influenced the jury, since both the prosecution and the defense focused on the inmate's knowledge of the shooting.",lexis

"The present case involves an action brought in the United States District Court for the District of Columbia by the plaintiff, a Swiss holding corporation, to recover assets seized by the United States under the Trading with the Enemy Act as enemy-owned property. The government defended on the ground, among others, that plaintiff was an ""enemy"" within the meaning of the act since it was intimately connected with a German corporation. Upon the government's motion, the District Court entered an order requiring the plaintiff to produce a large number of the records of a Swiss banking firm. Swiss law prohibited, under criminal sanctions, the disclosure of these records, and the Swiss government confiscated them. There was no proof of collusion between plaintiff and the Swiss government in the seizure of the records. Through the efforts of the plaintiff a considerable number of these records were released by the Swiss authorities and tendered the government for inspection. However, the District Court directed final dismissal of the action under Rule 37 of the Federal Rules of Civil Procedure for noncompliance with its production order. The Court of Appeals for the District of Columbia Circuit affirmed, notwithstanding its observation that plaintiff diligently sought to achieve compliance with the order (100 App DC 148, 243 F2d 254).",lexis

The Border Patrol agents, who stated that their only reason for stopping the defendant's car was that its three occupants appeared to be of Mexican descent, had discovered upon questioning the occupants that the passengers had entered the country illegally.

"A student newspaper published at Stanford University, and members of its staff, instituted a civil rights action in the United States District Court for the Northern District of California, seeking declaratory and injunctive relief against local police and law enforcement officials. The plaintiffs alleged that they had been deprived of their rights under the First, Fourth, and Fourteenth Amendments of the Federal Constitution because of a search of the newspaper's premises that had been conducted after the paper had published articles and photographs of a clash between demonstrators and police at the Stanford University Hospital--a municipal court having issued a warrant upon a finding of probable cause that the newspaper, although not involved in the unlawful acts, possessed negatives, photographs, and films relevant to the identification of demonstrators who had assaulted police officers. Granting declaratory relief, the District Court held that when a newspaper was the innocent object of a search, the First and Fourth Amendments generally required that a subpoena duces tecum, rather than a search warrant, must be used to obtain the evidence (353 F Supp 124).

Although the judge asked the prospective jurors three general questions as to bias, prejudice, or partiality, he declined to ask any of the four questions posed by the petitioner.

"Investigating a tip that the accused was growing marijuana plants in his backyard, and finding that they could not observe anything from ground level because the accused's yard was surrounded by a 6-foot outer fence and a 10-foot inner fence, police officers secured a private plane, flew over the yard at an altitude of 1,000 feet, and made naked-eye observations which provided the basis for a search warrant. After a California trial court denied the accused's motion to suppress the plants seized in the ensuing search, the accused pleaded guilty to a charge of cultivating marijuana. The California Court of Appeal, First District, reversed, holding that this warrantless aerial surveillance of the curtilage of the accused's home violated his rights under the Fourth Amendment. The Court of Appeal distinguished cases allowing warrantless aerial surveillance of open fields, ruled that the height and existence of the fences demonstrated the accused's reasonable expectation of privacy by any standard, and found it significant that the surveillance had not been the result of a routine patrol but had been conducted for the express purpose of observing this enclosure within the accused's curtilage (161 Cal App 3d 1081, 208 Cal Rptr 93).",lexis

"A California statute provides that, before additional nuclear power plants may be built, the state energy commission must determine on a case-by-case basis that there will be adequate capacity for storage of a plant's spent fuel rods at the time such nuclear facility requires such storage. Another section of the statute imposes a moratorium on the certification of new nuclear plants until the energy commission finds that there has been developed and that the United States through its authorized agency has approved and there exists a demonstrated technology or means for the disposal of high level nuclear waste. Two electric utility companies brought an action, requesting that the two sections of the California statute be declared invalid under the supremacy clause of the United States Constitution (Art VI, cl 2) because they are pre-empted by the Atomic Energy Act of 1954 (42 USCS 2011 et seq.). The United States District Court for the Eastern District of California held that the utility companies had standing to challenge the two sections, that the issues were ripe for adjudication, and that the two provisions were void because they were pre-empted by and in conflict with the Atomic Energy Act (489 F Supp 699). The United States Court of Appeals for the Ninth Circuit affirmed the District Court's ruling that the utility companies had standing and also agreed on the ripeness for review of the challenge to the provision imposing a moratorium on certification until the energy commission finds that there exists a demonstrated technology or means for the disposal of high level nuclear waste. The Court of Appeals concluded, however, that the challenge to the provision requiring the energy commission to determine on a case-by-case basis that there will be adequate capacity for storage of a plant's spent fuel rods was not ripe for review. The Court of Appeals held on the merits that the nuclear moratorium provisions that were ripe for adjudication were not pre-empted (659 F2d 903).",lexis

A three-judge court was convened as demanded by the claimant, who stipulated that some or all of the photographs were to be used in a book for commercial distribution. The District Court declared 1305 (a) unconstitutional on the grounds that it failed to specify procedural time limits for judicial determination of obscenity as required under the First Amendment, and that the statute's prohibition of importation of obscenity for private as well as commercial use was unconstitutional, since the First Amendment protected the right to receive and possess obscene material for private use in one's own home (309 F Supp 36).",lexis

"Two attorneys, licensed to practice law in Arizona, opened a law office, which they called a ""legal clinic,"" in Phoenix, aiming to provide legal services at modest fees to persons of moderate income who did not qualify for governmental legal aid. To achieve this end, they accepted only routine matters, such as uncontested divorces and changes of name, for which costs could be kept down by extensive use of paralegals, automatic typewriting equipment, and standardized forms and office procedures. After conducting their practice in this manner for two years, they concluded that their ""legal clinic"" could not survive unless the availability of legal services at low cost, and their fees for performing such services, were advertised. Consequently, in violation of Disciplinary Rule 2-101(B), embodied in Rule 29(a) of the Supreme Court of Arizona (17A Ariz Rev Stat (1976 Supp), p 26), which prohibited Arizona lawyers from publicizing themselves, their partners, or their associates, by ""commercial"" means, the two attorneys placed an advertisement in a Phoenix newspaper, stating that they were offering ""legal services at very reasonable fees,"" and listing their fees for uncontested divorces, uncontested non-business bankruptcies, and other matters. After the President of the State Bar filed a complaint, and hearings were held, the State Bar's Board of Governors recommended a one-week suspension for each attorney.

"In order to carry out its program for the maintenance of minimum retail prices, the defendant, a manufacturer of pharmaceutical products, discussed this program with retailers who sold below such minimum prices and told them that if they continued to do so it would refuse to deal with them. The defendant also informed wholesalers in the area that it would refuse to deal with them if they sold defendant's products to offending retailers. Similar tactics were followed to induce retailers not to advertise defendant's products at prices below its minimum retail prices. This program was carried out until the Department of Justice started an investigation under the Sherman Antitrust Act. In the present action the government sought an injunction under the Sherman Act against the defendant, alleging that defendant conspired and combined, in violation of 1 and 3 of the act, with retail and wholesale druggists in Washington, D. C., and Richmond, Virginia, to maintain the wholesale and retail prices of its products. The violation was alleged to have occurred during the summer of 1956 when there was no Fair Trade Law in the District of Columbia or State of Virginia. At the close of the government's evidence, the District Court dismissed the complaint on the ground that the government's proofs did not establish a violation of the act, because defendant's actions were merely a refusal to have business relations with retailers who disregarded its price policy, and hence were sanctioned under the doctrine laid down in United States v Colgate Co. 250 US 300, 63 L ed 992, 39 S Ct 465, 7 ALR 443.

"From 1979 to 1984, all Muslim inmates of a New Jersey state prison were permitted to attend Jumu'ah, a weekly congregational service of central religious importance to them, which was held in the prison's main facility. In 1983, New Jersey corrections officials required one class of minimum-security prisoners to work outside the main facility, and in 1984, prison officials prohibited all minimum-security prisoners who were assigned to outside work details from returning to the main facility during the workday, except in cases of emergency. As a result of these regulations, most of the Muslim minimum-security inmates were prevented from attending Jumu'ah, although their freedom to participate in certain other Muslim observances remained unrestricted. Two Muslim inmates filed suit in the United States District Court for the District of New Jersey under 42 USCS 1983, seeking damages and injunctive relief on the ground that the regulations denied them their rights under the First Amendment's free exercise of religion clause. The District Court entered judgment for the prison officials, holding that (1) the prison regulations plausibly advanced the goals of security, order, and rehabilitation, and (2) no less restrictive alternative could be adopted without compromising a legitimate institutional objective (595 F Supp 928). A panel of the United States Court of Appeals for the Third Circuit heard the prisoners' appeal and decided it under existing Third Circuit case law, which did not require any inquiry into the feasibility of accommodating prisoners' religious practices where prison officials stated that such practices raised potential security concerns. However, the Court of Appeals, rehearing the case en banc, vacated the District Court's judgment and remanded, holding that the prison regulations could be sustained only if the officials showed that (1) the regulations served the penological goal of security, and (2) no reasonable method existed by which prisoners' religious rights could be accommodated without creating bona fide security problems (782 F2d 416).",lexis
"A Michigan resident was arrested after police observed him engaged in a sexual act with a prostitute in a parked automobile. The automobile was jointly owned by the resident and his wife. The resident was convicted of gross indecency, and the state thereafter sued the resident and his wife in state court to have the automobile forfeited as a public nuisance under Michigan's public nuisance abatement statutes. The trial court ordered the forfeiture of the automobile, rejecting the wife's argument that her interest in the automobile should not be abated because of her lack of knowledge that her husband would use the automobile to violate the state's indecency laws. The Michigan Court of Appeals reversed, expressing the view that state supreme court precedent prevented the state from abating the wife's interest absent proof that she knew to what end the car would be used, or, alternatively, that the conduct in question did not qualify as a public nuisance (200 Mich App 670, 504 NW2d 731). The Michigan Supreme Court reversed, reinstating the abatement and concluding that (1) the episode in the vehicle was an abatable nuisance, (2) the state did not need to prove that the owner knew or agreed that her vehicle would be used in an unlawful manner when she entrusted it to another user, and (3) even if it were assumed that the wife did not know of or consent to the misuse of the vehicle, the state's failure to provide an innocent-owner defense was without constitutional consequence (447 Mich 719, 527 NW2d 731).",lexis

"These two consolidated cases challenged the constitutionality, under the Fourth Amendment, of New York statutory provisions authorizing police officers to enter a private residence without a warrant and with force, if necessary, to make a routine felony arrest. In No. 78-5420, the police, after assembling sufficient evidence to establish probable cause that an individual had committed a homicide, but without obtaining a warrant, went to the individual's apartment intending to arrest him. When there was no response to their knock at the door, the police broke open the door and entered the apartment. No one was in the apartment, but in plain view was a shell casing which was seized. At the individual's murder trial the trial judge refused to suppress the shell casing, holding that the warrantless and forcible entry of the defendant's apartment was authorized by the then applicable New York statute and that the casing, having been in plain view, was properly seized. The Supreme Court of New York, Appellate Division, First Department, summarily affirmed (55 App Div 2d 859, 390 NYS2d 769). In No. 78-5421, the police had obtained identification evidence that an individual had committed two armed robberies. Two months after learning his address, but without obtaining a warrant, the police went to the individual's home and knocked on the door. When the individual's young son opened the door, the police, who could see the individual sitting in bed, entered and arrested him. Before permitting him to dress, the police opened a chest of drawers two feet from the bed in search of weapons and found narcotics and related paraphernalia, which resulted in the individual's indictment on narcotics charges. At a suppression hearing, the trial judge held that the warrantless entry was authorized by a revised version of the New York statute involved in No. 78-5420, and that the search of the immediate area was reasonable. The Supreme Court of New York, Appellate Division, Second Department, affirmed the denial of the suppression motion (56 App Div 2d 937, 392 NYS2d 848).

Under 2(b) of the McCarran-Ferguson Act (15 USCS 1012(b)), which was enacted in 1945, an act of Congress may not be construed to invalidate, impair, or supersede any state law enacted for the purpose of regulating the business of insurance unless the congressional act ""specifically relates to the business of insurance."" In 1974, the state of Florida enacted a statute which prohibited the selling of most kinds of insurance in Florida by all banks except those which were located in a city having a population of less than 5,000 and which were not a subsidiary or an affiliate of a bank holding company. In 1993, an affiliated national bank which did business through a branch in a Florida town with a population of less than 5,000 bought a Florida-licensed insurance agency. On the day of the purchase, the bank filed an action in the United States District Court for the Middle District of Florida against the Florida insurance commissioner for permanent injunctive and declaratory relief, on the grounds that 92 pre-empted the Florida statute. Four days later, the commissioner ordered the agency to stop selling the prohibited kinds of insurance. Thereafter, the bank moved in District Court for a preliminary injunction against the commissioner. The District Court, denying both preliminary and permanent relief, ruled that 92 did not pre-empt the Florida statute, as (1) the Florida statute was a law enacted for the purpose of regulating the business of insurance within the meaning of 2(b), and (2) 92 did not fall within 2(b)'s anti-pre-emption rule because 92 did not specifically relate to the business of insurance (839 F Supp 835).

"After the United States District Court for the Northern District of Illinois, in a class action against the Chicago Housing Authority by Negro tenants in or applicants for public housing in Chicago, had found that the Authority had violated the plaintiffs' constitutional rights by selecting public housing sites and assigning tenants on the basis of race, the District Court dismissed the plaintiffs' complaint in their companion suit against the United States Department of Housing and Urban Development based on the Department's alleged participation in the discriminatory housing program. The United States Court of Appeals for the Seventh Circuit reversed and ordered the District Court to enter summary judgment for the plaintiffs, holding that the Department had violated both the Fifth Amendment and 601 of the Civil Rights Act of 1964 (42 USCS 2000d) by knowingly assisting the Authority's racially discriminatory public housing program through providing financial assistance and other support for such program (448 F2d 731).

"An action against the Federal Election Commission and various government officials was instituted in the United States District Court for the District of Columbia by various individuals and groups, including federal officeholders, candidates, and political organizations, challenging the constitutionality of certain provisions of the Federal Election Campaign Act of 1971 (generally 2 USCS 431 et seq., 18 USCS 591 et seq.) and the provisions of Subtitle H of the Internal Revenue Code of 1954 (26 USCS 9001 et seq.) for public financing of Presidential election campaigns. The principal statutes involved--attacked primarily as violating First Amendment speech and association rights and Fifth Amendment equal protection principles--(a) limit political contributions by individuals or groups to any single candidate for a federal elective office to $ 1,000 (18 USCS 608(b)(1)), limit contributions to any such candidate by political committees to $ 5,000 (18 USCS 608(b)(2)), and impose a $ 25,000 annual limitation on total contributions by any contributor (18 USCS 608(b)(3)); (b) limit independent expenditures by an individual or group advocating the election or defeat of a clearly identified candidate for federal office to $ 1,000 per year (18 USCS 608(e)(1)), set limits, depending on the office involved, on expenditures by a candidate for federal office during any calendar year (18 USCS 608(a)(1)), and establish limits, depending on the office involved, on overall campaign expenditures by candidates (18 USCS 608(c)); (c) require political committees to report to the Federal Election Commission the names of persons contributing more than $ 10, with the names of those contributing more than $ 100 in a calendar year being subject to public inspection (2 USCS 431 et seq.), and require every person or group (other than a political committee or candidate) who makes independent political contributions or expenditures exceeding $ 100 in a calendar year, other than by contribution to a political committee or candidate, to file a statement with the Commission (2 USCS 434(e)); and (d) provide for the public financing from general revenues of Presidential nominating conventions, general election campaigns, and primary campaigns, with the principal portion of public funds being allocated to ""major"" political parties (parties receiving 25% or more of the vote in the most recent Presidential election) and their candidates (26 USCS 9001 et seq.). The plaintiffs also contended that the method of appointment of members of the Federal Election Commission under 2 USCS 437c(a)(1)--which provides that two of the six voting members are to be appointed by the President pro tempore of the Senate, two are to be appointed by the Speaker of the House of Representatives, and two are to be appointed by the President, with all six members being subject to confirmation by the majority of both Houses of Congress--violated the principle of separation of powers as contained in the provisions of the appointments clause of the Constitution (Art II, 2, cl 2) requiring that the President, with the advice and consent of the Senate, shall appoint all officers of the United States whose appointments are not otherwise provided for in the Constitution, unless Congress vests the appointment of such officers in the President alone, in the courts, or in the heads of departments. Pursuant to 2 USCS 437h, the District Court certified the constitutional questions to the United States Court of Appeals for the District of Columbia Circuit, which rejected the plaintiffs' constitutional attacks on the basic statutory provisions involved (171 App DC 172, 519 F2d 821). To avoid any possible questions as to jurisdiction to hear the challenge to the constitutionality of Subtitle H of the Internal Revenue Code, a three-judge District Court sat jointly with the Court of Appeals and adopted the Court of Appeals' opinion on such matter (401 F Supp 1235).",lexis
"The United States, as trustee for certain Indian tribes and as owner of various non-Indian government claims, brought an action in the United States District Court for the District of Colorado to obtain a determination of its rights in certain waters and tributaries located in Colorado Water Division No. 7. After one of the defendants in the federal action filed a state court action seeking an order directing service of process on the United States for the purpose of adjudicating all of the United States' claims, several defendants and intervenors in the federal proceeding moved the Federal District Court to dismiss on the ground that under the McCarran amendment (43 USCS 666)--which provides for consent to join the United States as a defendant in any suit for the adjudication of rights to the use of water where the United States owns or is acquiring such rights--the Federal District Court had no jurisdiction to determine federal water rights. The Federal District Court, without deciding the jurisdictional question, granted the motion, ruling that the doctrine of abstention required deference to the state court proceedings, but the United States Court of Appeals for the Tenth Circuit reversed, holding that abstention was inappropriate, and that the action was within the Federal District Court's jurisdiction under 28 USCS 1345, giving the Federal District Courts original jurisdiction of all civil actions commenced by the United States, ""[e]xcept as otherwise provided by Act of Congress"" (504 F2d 115).",lexis

On appeal, the defendants argued that their convictions were unlawful as products of invidious racial discrimination, because if a non-Indian had committed the crime--the killing of a non-Indian during a burglary and robbery within the boundaries of the Indian reservation--the case would have been prosecuted under the law of the state where the reservation was located (Idaho), and under such law, proof of premeditation and deliberation would have been required, whereas no such elements were required under the applicable federal law.

"In 1989, the state of Oregon--which already levied a wide range of fees on landfill operators to fund the state's comprehensive regulation of solid waste disposal--imposed a surcharge on the disposal within the state of solid waste generated out of state. The statute imposing the surcharge provided that the amount of the surcharge had to be based on the costs to the state and its political subdivisions of disposing of such out-of-state waste that was not otherwise paid for under specified statutes. A state agency set the surcharge, by rule, at $ 2.25 per ton. In conjunction with the surcharge, the state imposed a fee, capped at $ 0.85 per ton, on the in-state disposal of waste generated within the state. The operator of a solid waste landfill, and a company which transported solid waste from another state to a landfill in Oregon, (1) sought expedited review of the surcharge in the Oregon Court of Appeals, and (2) alleged that the surcharge and its enabling statutes violated the Federal Constitution's commerce clause (Art I, 8, cl 3). The Court of Appeals, however, upheld the statutes and rule (114 Or App 369, 837 P2d 965). The Supreme Court of Oregon affirmed, stating that the surcharge was not facially discriminatory against interstate commerce, despite the statute's express reference to the geographic origin of waste, because of the express statutory nexus between the surcharge and the actual costs incurred by state and local government (316 Or 99, 849 P2d 500).",lexis

The general obligation bonds were to be issued to finance various municipal improvements, with the largest amounts to go for the city sewer system, parks and playgrounds, police and public safety buildings, and libraries. Pursuant to Arizona constitutional and statutory provisions, only otherwise qualified voters who were also real-property taxpayers were permitted to vote on these bond issues. All of the bond issues submitted to the voters were approved by a majority of those voting. After the election, a Phoenix resident who was otherwise qualified to vote, but who owned no real property, filed a complaint in the United States District Court for the District of Arizona challenging the constitutionality of the restriction on the franchise in Arizona bond elections and attacking the validity of the election approving the Phoenix bond issues.

The statute did not require a school to teach either creation science or evolution science, but provided that if either one was taught, the other must also be taught. Under the statute, curriculum guides and research services were to be developed and supplied for creation science, and only ""creation scientists"" were to serve on the panel supplying the research services. In addition, the statute forbade school boards to discriminate against anyone who chose to be a creation scientist or to teach ""creationism."" The stated purpose of the statute was to protect ""academic freedom."" The statute was challenged as invalid, under both the First Amendment's establishment of religion clause and the Louisiana state constitution, by parents of children attending Louisiana public schools, Louisiana teachers, and religious leaders, who sought an injunction and declaratory relief in the United States District Court for the Eastern District of Louisiana. State officials agreed not to implement the statute pending the final outcome of the litigation. The state constitutional challenge was ultimately rejected by the Louisiana Supreme Court (440 So 2d 704), but the District Court granted summary judgment to the challengers as to the First Amendment claim, on the ground that the statute violated the establishment clause either because it prohibited the teaching of evolution or because it required the teaching of creation science with the purpose of advancing a particular religious doctrine (634 F Supp 426). The United States Court of Appeals for the Fifth Circuit affirmed, observing that the statute's avowed purpose of protecting academic freedom was inconsistent with requiring, upon risk of sanction, the teaching of creation science whenever evolution is taught (765 F2d 1251, reh den 778 F2d 225).",lexis

Subsequently, the federally recognized tribe maintained its own government on the 800 reserved acres. Under a tax code administered by the tribe, the tribe imposed (1) a tax on the earnings of any individual employed within tribal jurisdiction, whether or not such individual was a member of the tribe; and (2) a motor vehicle tax and registration fee on all motor vehicles principally garaged within tribal jurisdiction and owned by tribal residents. Under Oklahoma statutes, (1) all residents of Oklahoma who received income in Oklahoma were subject to state income taxes; (2) an excise tax, in addition to the state sales tax, was levied on all transfers of ownership or use of vehicles registered in Oklahoma; and (3) a vehicle registration fee was assessed for all vehicles registered with Oklahoma. Oklahoma claimed that residents within the jurisdiction of the tribe were subject to both state and tribal income taxes. Oklahoma did not attempt to collect excise taxes and registration fees from members of the tribe who registered their vehicles with the tribe. However, if a tribal member transferred ownership of a vehicle to a nonmember who sought licensing and registration from Oklahoma, such subsequent owner was required to pay (1) current and delinquent excise taxes; and (2) registration fees for the current year and registration fees and penalties for one previous year. The tribe brought an action in the United States District Court for the Western District of Oklahoma against the Oklahoma tax commission and sought a permanent injunction barring the commission from imposing (1) the Oklahoma income tax on (a) people who earned their income within tribal jurisdiction, and (b) people who resided within the tribe's jurisdiction; and (2) the Oklahoma vehicle excise tax and registration fees on vehicles owned by residents of, and principally garaged within, tribal jurisdiction where such vehicles lawfully were registered with the tribe. On cross-motions for summary judgment, the District Court ruled that (1) the commission could tax the income earned by nontribal members on trust lands, but not the income that tribal members earned from tribal employment on trust lands; and (2) the commission could not require, as a prerequisite to issuing an Oklahoma vehicle title, payment of excise taxes and registration fees for the years a vehicle properly had been registered with the tribe. On appeal by both parties, the United States Court of Appeals for the Tenth Circuit, affirming, expressed the view that (1) the income of tribal members who worked for the tribe on trust land was immune from state taxation, but the income of nonmembers was not immune; and (2) although Oklahoma could not impose vehicle excise taxes and registration fees with respect to vehicles formerly owned by tribal members and registered with the tribe, Oklahoma could impose such taxes with respect to vehicles registered with the tribe by nonmembers (967 F2d 1425).",lexis
"These cases raised the issue whether the due process clause of the Fourteenth Amendment affords the right to trial by jury in state juvenile delinquency proceedings. No. 322 involved separate proceedings against two boys, 15 and 16 years old, respectively, in the Juvenile Branch of the Court of Common Pleas of Philadelphia County, Pennsylvania, charging as acts of juvenile delinquency conduct by the juvenile in one case which constituted felonies under Pennsylvania law, and conduct amounting to misdemeanors in the second case. The trial judge in each case denied a request for jury trial, and adjudged the juvenile as delinquent on the respective charges, one of the juveniles being put on probation and the other being committed to an institution. The Superior Court of Pennsylvania affirmed both orders without opinion. (215 Pa Super 760, 255 A2d 921; 215 Pa Super 762, 255 A2d 922.) Consolidating the appeals in both cases, the Supreme Court of Pennsylvania affirmed, holding that there was no constitutional right to a jury trial in the juvenile court. (438 Pa 339, 265 A2d 350.) In No. 128, a group of children, ranging in age from 11 to 15 years, were charged by juvenile petitions in the District Court, Hyde County, North Carolina, with various acts amounting to misdemeanors under state law, which acts arose out of a series of demonstrations protesting school assignments and a school consolidation plan. Consolidating the several cases into groups for hearing, the trial judge excluded the general public over counsel's objection in all but two of the cases; denied a request for jury trial in each case; and entered a custody commitment order in each case, declaring the juvenile a delinquent and placing each juvenile on probation after suspending the commitments.

In No. 413 the respondent was convicted in a North Carolina court of assault with intent to commit rape, and was sentenced to prison for a term of 12 to 15 years. Several years later, in a post conviction proceeding his conviction was reversed by the Supreme Court of North Carolina on the ground that an involuntary confession had been unconstitutionally admitted in evidence against him (266 NC 234, 145 SE2d 918). He was then retried, convicted, and sentenced to an 8-year prison term, which, when added to the time he had already spent in prison, amounted to a longer total sentence than that originally imposed, and the conviction and sentence were affirmed on appeal (268 NC 707, 151 SE2d 571). He then began a habeas corpus proceeding in the United States District Court for the Eastern District of North Carolina, and that court held that the longer sentence imposed on retrial was ""unconstitutional and void,"" and upon the state court's failure to resentence the respondent within 60 days, ordered his release. This order was affirmed by the United States Court of Appeals for the Fourth Circuit (397 F2d 253). In No. 418 the respondent pleaded guilty in an Alabama court to four separate charges of second degree burglary, and was sentenced to prison terms aggregating 10 years, but such judgments were set aside 2 1/2 years later in a coram nobis proceeding, on the ground that the respondent had not been accorded his constitutional right to counsel. He was retried on three of the charges, convicted, and sentenced to prison terms aggregating 25 years, with no credit being given for the time he had spent in prison on the original sentence. He then brought a habeas corpus proceeding in the United States District Court for the Middle District of Alabama, which, upon upholding his contentions that the state trial court had acted unconstitutionally in failing to give him credit for the time he had already served in prison, and in imposing grossly harsher sentences upon retrial, found that he had been denied due process of law, because under the evidence the conclusion was inescapable that Alabama was punishing him for having exercised his postconviction right of review and for having the original sentences declared unconstitutional (274 F Supp 116), and the United States Court of Appeals for the Fifth Circuit affirmed (396 F2d 499).",lexis

"Approximately 100 years after the United States had breached an 1854 treaty with the Delaware Indians by privately selling certain reservation tribal trust lands, rather than selling them at public auction as required under the treaty, claims arising out of the breach were brought before the Indian Claims Commission by two federally recognized Indian tribes--(1) the ""Cherokee Delawares,"" the descendants of Delawares who moved from Missouri to a reservation in Kansas, and then, as the result of an 1866 treaty, to lands in Oklahoma, and (2) the ""Absentee Delawares,"" the descendants of Delawares who never moved to the Kansas reservation, but migrated to Oklahoma and settled with the Wichita and Caddo Indians. Finding that the two tribes were entitled jointly to represent the entire Delaware tribe, the Commission awarded them over nine million dollars (21 Ind Cl Com 344). Congress appropriated funds to pay the award and enacted a federal statute (25 USCS 1291-1297), providing for distribution to the Cherokee and Absentee Delawares.

The three-judge District Court held that Congress' failure to include the Kansas Delawares in the distribution constituted a denial of equal protection of the laws under the due process clause of the Fifth Amendment, and enjoined the Secretary of the Interior from distributing any of the appropriated funds pending amendment of the statute or enactment of further legislation (406 F Supp 1309).",lexis

The candidate could provide the test specimen at a laboratory approved by the state or at the office of the candidate's personal physician. Once a urine sample was obtained, a state-approved laboratory determined whether any of the specified illegal drugs were present and prepared a certificate reporting the test results to the candidate. In 1994, three candidates for state offices which were covered by the statute filed an action in the United States District Court for the Northern District of Georgia against the governor of Georgia and two other state officials involved in the administration of the statute.

"Rule 104(a) of the Federal Rules of Evidence provides that preliminary questions as to the admissibility of evidence shall be determined by the trial court. Rule 404(b) of the Federal Rules generally prohibits the introduction of extrinsic acts that might reflect adversely on the actor's character, unless that evidence has a bearing upon a relevant issue in the case such as motive, opportunity, or knowledge. In a federal prosecution for possessing and selling stolen goods in violation of 18 USCS 659 and 2315, where the charges were related to some stolen videocassette tapes and one issue at trial was whether the accused knew the tapes were stolen, the United States District Court for the Eastern District of Michigan allowed the Federal Government, under Rule 404(b), to introduce evidence of an allegedly similar act of the accused--his sale, for $ 28 apiece, of 38 televisions which the accused had obtained from the same person who had provided the tapes to the accused--on the ground that such evidence had clear relevancy to the accused's knowledge with respect to the tapes. After the accused was convicted of one count under 659, the United States Court of Appeals for the Sixth Circuit, on appeal, initially reversed the accused's conviction, and expressed the view that (1) the District Court erred in admitting the evidence with respect to the televisions as a similar act under Rule 404(b), because the Federal Government had failed to prove by clear and convincing evidence that the televisions were stolen or that the accused knew that they were stolen; and (2) the admission of the evidence was not harmless error (802 F2d 874). On rehearing, however, the Court of Appeals instead upheld the accused's conviction, and expressed the view that (1) in order for similar-acts evidence which involved a prior bad act to be admissible, the Federal Government was required only to prove by a preponderance of the evidence that an accused had engaged in the prior bad act; (2) in the case at hand, it was not an abuse of the District Court's discretion to admit the similar-acts evidence with respect to the televisions; and (3) even if the District Court was mistaken in admitting the evidence, the error was harmless (811 F2d 974).",lexis

In support of the claim for injunctive relief, the complaint alleged that pursuant to the city's authorization, the city's police officers regularly and routinely applied the chokeholds in situations where they were not threatened by the use of any deadly force, that the citizen and others were threatened with irreparable injury in the form of bodily injury and loss of life, and that the citizen justifiably feared that any contact with the police might result in his being choked or strangled to death without provocation, justification or other legal excuse. The District Court entered a preliminary injunction against the use of chokeholds when the police were not threatened with death or serious bodily injury. The United States Court of Appeals for the Ninth Circuit affirmed, stating that the District Court had not abused its discretion in granting the preliminary injunction (656 F2d 417).",lexis
"A Washington state statute enacted in 1975 provided that a person was guilty of the felony of promoting a suicide attempt when the person knowingly caused or aided another person to attempt suicide. In 1994, an action was brought in the United States District Court for the Western District of Washington by several plaintiffs, among whom were (1) physicians who occasionally treated terminally ill, suffering patients, and (2) individuals who were then in the terminal phases of serious and painful illnesses. The plaintiffs, asserting the existence of a liberty interest protected by the Federal Constitution's Fourteenth Amendment which extended to a personal choice by a mentally competent, terminally ill adult to commit physician-assisted suicide, sought a declaratory judgment that the Washington statute was unconstitutional on its face. The District Court, granting motions for summary judgment by the physicians and the individuals, ruled that the statute was unconstitutional because it placed an undue burden on the exercise of the asserted liberty interest (850 F. Supp 1454, 1994 US Dist LEXIS 5831). On appeal, the United States Court of Appeals for the Ninth Circuit, ultimately affirming en banc, expressed the view that (1) the Constitution encompassed a due process liberty interest in controlling the time and manner of one's death; and (2) the Washington statute was unconstitutional as applied to terminally ill, competent adults who wished to hasten their deaths with medication prescribed by their physicians (79 F.3d 790, 1996 US App LEXIS 3944).",lexis
"The father of one of the tribal members had mortgaged to the bank fee land that was located on the tribal reservation. The land was subsequently deeded to the bank in lieu of foreclosure and was leased to the company with an option to purchase. The company was unable to exercise the option, and the bank sold the land to nonmembers of the tribe. Respondents sued the bank in tribal court, which found, inter alia, that the bank had discriminated against respondents by selling the land to nonmembers on more favorable terms. The tribal court awarded respondents damages and an option to purchase a portion of the land. The Supreme Court held that the tribal court lacked authority to adjudicate the discrimination claim. The bank had standing to raise a jurisdictional challenge, as it was injured by the tribal court's exercise of jurisdiction over the discrimination claim. The case did not fall within the Montana exceptions to the general rule that an Indian tribe lacked authority to regulate the activities of nonmembers. The tribe's limited authority to regulate nonmember activities on the reservation did not permit the tribe to regulate the sale of non-Indian fee land.",lexis
"As part of a routine drug interdiction effort, two police officers, both of whom were wearing badges and insignia and one of whom was holding a recognizable zipper pouch containing a pistol, boarded a bus bound from Miami to Atlanta during a stopover in Fort Lauderdale. Without articulable suspicion, the officers asked to inspect the ticket and identification of one of the passengers. The ticket matched the passenger's identification, and both were returned to him by the officers. Explaining that they were looking for illegal drugs, the officers requested the passenger's consent to search his luggage and advised him that he had the right to refuse such consent. After the passenger manifested consent, and a search of his luggage disclosed cocaine, he was charged in a Florida state court with trafficking in cocaine, and moved to suppress the cocaine on the ground that it had been seized in violation of the Federal Constitution's Fourth Amendment. The trial court denied the motion, and the passenger subsequently pleaded guilty but reserved the right to appeal the denial of the motion to suppress. On appeal, the Florida District Court of Appeal affirmed, but certified the suppression issue to the Supreme Court of Florida (510 So 2d 321). The Florida Supreme Court (1) stated that the passenger had been seized, because a reasonable passenger in his situation would not have felt free to leave the bus to avoid questioning by the police, and (2) held that an impermissible seizure results when police mount a drug search on buses during scheduled stops and question boarded passengers without articulable reasons for doing so, thereby obtaining consent to search the passengers' luggage (554 So 2d 1153).",lexis

The District Court entered judgment for the defendants, finding that the government's statistical evidence, showing that relatively small numbers of Negro teachers were employed by the school district, was nonprobative upon comparing the percentage of Negro teachers to the percentage of Negro pupils in the district, and ruling that the government's evidence failed to establish a pattern or practice of discrimination (392 F Supp 1276). The United States Court of Appeals for the Eighth Circuit reversed, holding that (1) the statistical comparison should have been made between the racial composition of the school district's teaching staff and the racial composition of the qualified public school teacher population in the relevant labor market, and (2) in accordance with the government's contention, the relevant labor market area included the nearby city of St. Louis as well as the county in which the defendant school district was located, notwithstanding the defendants' contention that statistical comparisons would be distorted by including St. Louis because of its special attempts to maintain a 50% Negro teaching staff--the Court of Appeals directing judgment for the government (534 F2d 805).",lexis

The Department concluded that the college was a recipient of federal financial assistance, and after the college refused to execute an assurance of compliance with Title IX of the Education Amendments of 1972 (20 USCS 1681 et seq.), which, inter alia, prohibits sex discrimination in any education program or activity receiving federal financial assistance, the Department initiated administrative proceedings to declare the college and its students ineligible to receive BEOGs. The administrative law judge found in favor of the Department and entered an order terminating assistance to the college. The college and four of its students brought suit in the District Court for the Western District of Pennsylvania, which concluded that the students' BEOGs constituted federal financial assistance to the college, but held that the Department could not terminate aid due to the college's refusal to execute the assurance.

"In view of the fact that the Federal Savings and Loan Insurance Corporation lacked the funds to liquidate all of the savings and loan associations (thrifts) that were failing during the early 1980's, the United States entered, with some financially healthy thrifts, contracts under which the Federal Home Loan Bank Board, in return for the healthy thrifts' takeovers, in a series of ""supervisory mergers,"" of financially ailing thrifts, permitted the acquiring thrifts to designate the excess of the purchase price over the fair value of identifiable assets as supervisory goodwill and to count such goodwill and certain capital credits toward the capital reserve requirements imposed on thrifts by federal regulations. Subsequently, Congress enacted a Financial Institutions Reform, Recovery, and Enforcement Act of 1989 provision (12 USCS 1464(t)) forbidding thrifts from counting the goodwill and capital credits in computing required capital reserves. In regard to three particular thrifts that had been created by supervisory mergers, two of the thrifts were seized and liquidated by federal regulators for failure to meet the 1464(t) capital requirements, and the third thrift, which also had fallen out of capital compliance as a result of 1464(t), avoided seizure through a private recapitalization. Believing that the Bank Board had promised that the supervisory goodwill could be counted toward the capital reserve requirements, each of the three acquiring thrifts filed suit against the United States and sought monetary damages on the basis of theories that included breach of contract. The United States Claims Court (later renamed the United States Court of Federal Claims), expressing the view in each case that the government had breached contractual obligations to permit the counting of supervisory goodwill and capital credits toward the regulatory capital requirements, granted the thrifts' motions for partial summary judgment on contract liability (21 Cl Ct 112; 25 Cl Ct 541; 26 Cl Ct 904). The three cases were then consolidated and the decisions were certified for interlocutory appeal. A United States Court of Appeals for the Federal Circuit panel initially reversed (994 F2d 797).

Conceding that the decision in Swain v Alabama (1965) 380 US 202, 13 L Ed 2d 759, 85 S Ct 824, which found no basis for an inference of purposeful discrimination where a defendant offered no proof, beyond the facts of his own case, of the circumstances under which prosecutors had used peremptory challenges to strike black jurors, apparently foreclosed his equal protection claim, the accused relied on other theories in appealing his subsequent conviction.

The failure to resolve the case before the election did not moot the matter, which was capable of repetition. Section 441a-1(a) violated theFirst Amendment because it imposed a substantial burden on the right to use personal funds for campaign speech and was not justified by a compelling state interest. The asymmetrical limits did not operate to prevent corruption, and a desire to level electoral opportunities for candidates of different personal wealth was not a legitimate government objective.

The owner of the terminal, a private corporation which opposed the landmark designation but which did not seek judicial review of the designation as authorized under the landmarks law, subsequently entered into a lease agreement whereby the lessee would construct a multistory office building in the space above the terminal. The owner and lessee then sought the Commission's approval for the contemplated construction as required under the landmarks law. Two plans for an office building of over 50 stories, both of which apparently satisfied the terms of the applicable zoning ordinance, were found unacceptable by the Commission. One of the plans was rejected because it involved tearing down a portion of the terminal and stripping off some of its features. The other plan, which involved cantilevering a 55-story building above the terminal's facade and resting it on the terminal's roof, was rejected because such a massive building would be aesthetically at odds with the terminal's architectural style.

The District Court (1) denied the motion to dismiss, but ordered any trial stayed until the end of Clinton's presidency (869 F Supp 690, 1994 US Dist LEXIS 18884). Also, the District Court ultimately stayed discovery pending appeal on the immunity issue (879 F Supp 86, 1995 US Dist LEXIS 2975). On appeal by Clinton and cross-appeal by the individual, the United States Court of Appeals for the Eighth Circuit (1) affirmed the denial of Clinton's motion to dismiss, but (2) reversed the order postponing trial (72 F.3d 1354, 1996 US App LEXIS 253).",lexis
"Respondent tried to steal a pair of shoes from a department store, drew a gun, fired at a store security officer, and wounded a bystander. Respondent initially was found incompetent to stand trial and was committed to a state hospital. After being found competent, respondent was recommitted. Subsequently, respondent was found competent to stand trial and requested to represent himself at trial. The trial court found that respondent was competent to stand trial, but found that he was not competent to defend himself. Respondent was represented by appointed counsel at his retrial. Under the Sixth and Fourteenth Amendments, the United States Supreme Court determined that a new trial was not warranted based on the denial of his self-representation request because the United States Constitution did not forbid the State from insisting that respondent proceed to trial with counsel, thereby denying him the right to represent himself. The United States Constitution permitted the State to limit respondent's self-representation right by insisting upon representation by counsel at trial on the ground that he lacked the mental capacity to conduct his trial defense unless represented.",lexis
"The issue was whether the protection afforded by Title VII of the Civil Rights Act of 1964, 42 U.S.C.S. _ 2000e et seq., extended to an employee who spoke out about discrimination not on her own initiative, but in answering questions during an employer's internal investigation. The lower court thought that answering questions fell short of opposition, finding that the opposition clause of 42 U.S.C.S. _ 2000e-3(a) demanded active, consistent opposing activities to warrant protection against retaliation. Given the use of the word ""oppose"" in ordinary discourse, there was no reason to doubt that a person could oppose by responding to someone else's question. Moreover, a possibility that an employer might someday want to fire someone who might charge discrimination traceable to an internal investigation was unlikely to diminish the attraction of an Ellerth-Faragher affirmative defense. Thus, the employee's conduct was covered by the opposition clause of 42 U.S.C.S. _ 2000e-3(a).",lexis
"Section 43-1089 allowed tax credits for contributions to school tuition organizations (STOs), which provided scholarships to students attending private schools, including religious schools. The taxpayers claimed that the STO tax credit violated the Establishment Clause. The Supreme Court held that the taxpayers lacked standing under U.S. Const. art. III. The general rule against taxpayer standing applied, and the taxpayers failed to establish that they fell within the exception to the rule for claims of extraction and spending of tax money in violation of the Establishment Clause. The tax credit under ¬¨√ü 43-1089 was not a governmental expenditure; contributors to STOs spent their own money, not money collected by the state from taxpayers. The tax credit was not tantamount to a religious tax or a tithe. The causation and redressability requirements for standing also were not satisfied; although the state afforded the opportunity to create and contribute to an STO, the tax credit system was implemented by private action with no state intervention, and an injunction limiting the tax credit's operation would not have remedied the alleged injury.",lexis

"A husband and wife residing in the state of Washington purchased passage for a cruise between Los Angeles, California and Puerto Vallarta, Mexico on a ship operated by a Panamanian corporation which had its principal place of business in Miami, Florida. The ""passage contract tickets"" received by the couple contained a clause designating courts located in the state of Florida as the agreed-upon exclusive venue for litigating any disputes arising under the contract between passenger and carrier. While the cruise ship was in international waters off the coast of Mexico, the wife fell and was injured; and the couple, claiming that the wife's injuries had been caused by the negligence of the cruise line and its employees, subsequently filed suit against the corporation in the United States District Court for the Western District of Washington. The District Court granted the corporation's motion for summary judgment, on the ground that the corporation's contacts with the state of Washington were insufficient to support the District Court's exercise of personal jurisdiction over the corporation. However, the United States Court of Appeals for the Ninth Circuit eventually reversed and remanded, as it held that (1) the corporation had sufficient contacts with the state to support personal jurisdiction; and (2) it would be unreasonable to apply the forum-selection clause of the ticket contract in the case at hand, because (a) the clause was not freely bargained for, and (b) as an independent rationale, there was evidence in the record to indicate that the couple were physically and financially incapable of pursuing the litigation in Florida (897 F2d 377).",lexis

Plaintiffs' claim was that enforcement of the statute, which altered the shape of the city from a square to a 28-sided figure and removed from the city all save a few Negro voters but no white voter, constituted a discrimination against them in violation of the due process and equal protection clauses of the Fourteenth Amendment and denied them the right to vote, in defiance of the Fifteenth Amendment.

"When the Federal Communications Commission (FCC) compares competing applications for a new radio or television broadcast station license, it awards an enhancement credit for ownership and participation by members of minority groups, defined by the FCC as ""those of Black, Hispanic Surnamed, American Eskimo, Aleut, American Indian, and Asiatic American extraction."" In addition, the FCC seeks to promote minority ownership of broadcast stations through its ""distress sale"" policy, under which a licensee whose qualifications to hold a broadcast license have come into question may, if certain conditions are met, assign its license to an FCC-approved minority enterprise without the hearing that is ordinarily required before a license may be assigned. Two consolidated cases presented the question whether these FCC policies violate the equal protection component of the Federal Constitution's Fifth Amendment. In the first case (No. 89-453), a license applicant which was 90-percent Hispanic-owned was granted a license, where the FCC's Review Board found that the credit to be applied for minority ownership outweighed another applicant's local residence and civic participation advantage. The FCC denied review of the Board's decision, and the disappointed applicant sought review in the United States Court of Appeals for the District of Columbia Circuit. At the FCC's request, the court remanded the record for further consideration in light of a separate FCC inquiry regarding the validity of its minority and female ownership policies, including the minority enhancement credit policy. Prior to the completion of this inquiry, however, Congress enacted, and the President signed into law, appropriations legislation (101 Stat 1329-31) which prohibited the FCC from spending any appropriated funds to examine or change its minority ownership policies. The FCC thereupon closed its inquiry into those policies and reaffirmed its grant of the broadcast license. The Court of Appeals upheld the grant (277 App DC 134, 873 F2d 347). In the second case (No. 89-700), a licensee of a television station sought FCC permission to assign its broadcast license to a minority applicant pursuant to the ""distress sale"" policy. Another applicant urged the FCC to deny the request and to schedule a comparative hearing on the award of the license. The FCC approved the assignment of the license. The disappointed applicant appealed the FCC's order to the United States Court of Appeals for the District of Columbia Circuit. As in the first case, disposition of the appeal was delayed pending the FCC's review of its minority ownership policies, but, upon the enactment of the prohibitory appropriations legislation, the FCC reaffirmed its approval of the license assignment. The Court of Appeals, invalidating the ""distress sale"" policy as depriving the disappointed applicant of its equal protection rights under the Fifth Amendment, expressed the view that the policy (1) was not narrowly tailored to remedy past discrimination or to promote programming diversity; (2) unduly burdened the disappointed applicant, an innocent nonminority; and (3) was not reasonably related to the interests that the policy sought to vindicate (278 App DC 24, 876 F2d 902).",lexis
"During 1983, an anesthesiologist spent 30 to 35 hours per week with patients at three hospitals. At the hospitals--none of which provided the anesthesiologist with an office--he administered anesthesia, cared for patients after surgery, and treated patients for pain. At the condominium in which he resided, the anesthesiologist used a spare bedroom exclusively as an office, and although he did not meet patients in the office, he spent 2 to 3 hours per day there on such tasks as contacting patients, surgeons, and hospitals by telephone; maintaining billing records and patient logs; preparing for treatments and presentations; satisfying continuing medical education requirements; and reading medical journals and books. On the anesthesiologist's 1983 federal income tax return, he claimed a deduction for the portion of condominium fees, utilities, and depreciation attributable to the office. Upon audit of the return, the Commissioner of Internal Revenue disallowed these deductions based on a determination that the office in the anesthesiologist's home was not his principal place of business. In reviewing the Commissioner's decision, the United States Tax Court ruled that the office was the anesthesiologist's principal place of business (94 TC 20). On appeal, the United States Court of Appeals for the Fourth Circuit affirmed the Tax Court judgment (935 F2d 52). The Court of Appeals applied a test under which an office in a taxpayer's home may qualify as the taxpayer's principal place of business if (1) the office is essential to the taxpayer's business, (2) the taxpayer spends substantial time there, and (3) there is no other location available for performance of the business' office functions.",lexis

"In addition to questions pertaining to alleged constitutional violations affecting the validity of a state court conviction for murder, this case presented the major question of the constitutionality of the imposition of the death penalty under an Ohio statute requiring a death sentence for a conviction of aggravated murder with at least one of seven aggravating circumstances, unless, considering the nature and circumstances of the offense and the history, character, and condition of the offender, the sentencer (the trial judge in a jury case, or the three-judge panel which tries the case when a jury is waived) determines that a preponderance of the evidence establishes that (1) the victim induced or facilitated the offense, (2) it is unlikely that the offense would have been committed but for the fact that the offender was under duress, coercion, or strong provocation, or (3) the offense was primarily the product of the offender's psychosis or mental deficiency (not amounting to insanity). After a jury trial in an Ohio state court, the defendant was convicted of aggravated murder with specifications that it was committed to escape apprehension for, and while committing or attempting to commit, aggravated robbery. The prosecution's evidence showed that the defendant, with others, helped plan the robbery of a pawnshop, and that she was in the escape car during the attempted robbery, when the pawnbroker was shot by one of the other participants in the attempted robbery. After considering a presentence report and psychiatric and psychological reports which showed that the defendant was not suffering from a mental deficiency, and after hearing argument on the penalty issue, the trial judge concluded that he had no alternative but to impose the death penalty. The Court of Appeals of Summit County, Ohio, affirmed, as did the Supreme Court of Ohio (49 Ohio St 2d 48, 358 NE2d 1062).",lexis
"In 1983, for the purpose of ameliorating an extreme fractionation problem attending a former federal policy that had resulted in multiple ownership of single parcels of allotted Indian lands, Congress enacted the original version of 207 of the Indian Land Consolidation Act (25 USCS 2206) (the ""original 207""), which required that in specified circumstances, a small interest in such a fractionated parcel had to escheat--be transferred--to an Indian tribe upon the death of the owner of the interest. However, in Hodel v Irving (1987) 481 US 704, 95 L Ed 2d 668, 107 S Ct 2076, the United States Supreme Court held that the original 207 effected a taking of private property without just compensation, in violation of the Federal Constitution's Fifth Amendment. Meanwhile, in 1984, Congress had enacted some amendments to 207. The version which resulted (the ""amended 207"") (later revised on minor grounds which are not relevant) then (1) permitted a 5-year window--rather than the 1-year window of the original 207--for assessing the income-generating capacity of a fractional interest in order to determine whether the interest was subject to escheat; (2) modified the total prohibition in the original 207 against the descent or devise of otherwise escheatable interests, by permitting such interests to be devised to persons who already owned an interest in the same parcel; and (3) permitted tribes to establish their own codes to govern the disposition of fractional interests. In 1990, a member of the Sioux and Assiniboine Tribes of the Fort Peck Reservation in Montana died and left a will, which devised each of his several undivided interests in allotted lands to a single descendant. These interests were valued together at $ 1,239 and were determined in an administrative proceeding to be subject to escheat under the amended 207. The deceased member's children and potential heirs--after unsuccessfully attempting to raise a constitutional challenge to the amended 207 in the administrative proceeding--then (1) filed suit in the United States District Court for the District of Montana, (2) named the Secretary of the Interior as a defendant, and (3) alleged that the amended 207 violated the Fifth Amendment's just compensation clause.

The FDA emphasized, however, that its determination was not to be construed as an endorsement of the lead's safety. In 1987, an individual was implanted with a pacemaker which was equipped with one of the manufacturer's leads. In 1990, the pacemaker failed, and the individual required emergency surgery. According to the individual's treating physician, the failure of the pacemaker had been caused by a defect in the lead. In 1993, the individual and her husband filed an action in a Florida state court against the manufacturer. The complaint, in which the couple sought damages for the individual's injuries and the husband's loss of consortium, included claims based on (1) negligent design of the pacemaker, (2) negligent manufacture of the pacemaker, and (3) negligent failure to warn or properly instruct the individual or her physicians of the tendency of the pacemaker to fail. The manufacturer removed the case to the United States District Court for the Middle District of Florida on the basis of diversity of citizenship.

The Taiwanese company filed a cross-complaint seeking indemnification from, among others, the Japanese company. The motorcycle driver settled his claims against the Taiwanese company and the other defendants, leaving only the Taiwanese company's indemnity action against the Japanese company. The Japanese company moved to quash the Taiwanese company's service of summons, claiming that the state could not exert jurisdiction over it consistent with the due process clause of the Fourteenth Amendment of the Federal Constitution. In affidavits submitted in connection with the motion to quash, it appeared that while the Japanese company was fully aware that tire valve assemblies it sold to the Taiwanese company would end up throughout the United States and in California, the Japanese company never contemplated that its limited sales to the Taiwanese company in Taiwan would subject the Japanese company to lawsuits in California. The Superior Court denied the motion to quash summons, and the Court of Appeal of California issued a peremptory writ of mandate commanding the Superior Court to quash service of summons.

Thereafter, the parties who had been unsuccessful in obtaining access to the Secretary of State's notes instituted actions in the United States District Court for the District of Columbia to obtain enforcement of their requests for information under the Freedom of Information Act, which vests jurisdiction in Federal District Courts to enjoin an ""agency from withholding agency records and to order the production of any agency records improperly withheld from the complainant"" (5 USCS 552(a)(4)(B)), the plaintiffs seeking a judgment declaring that the notes they sought were agency records that had been unlawfully removed and improperly withheld, and requesting, as ultimate relief, that the court require the Library of Congress to return the notes to the Department of State with directions to process them for disclosure under the Freedom of Information Act. On cross motions for summary judgment, the District Court denied relief as to notes of conversations of the Secretary of State produced while he served as National Security Advisor to the President, but ruled in the plaintiffs' favor as to notes produced while he served as Secretary of State, the court finding in regard to the latter notes that such notes were ""agency records"" subject to disclosure under the Freedom of Information Act, that the Secretary of State had wrongfully removed notes of such type from his State Department office, and that although the Freedom of Information Act did not directly provide for relief since the records, at the time of the requests for access, were in the custody of the Library of Congress (an entity which was not an ""agency"" under the Freedom of Information Act), the Act nonetheless permitted the court to invoke its equitable powers to order the return of wrongfully removed agency documents when a statutory retrieval action appeared unlikely (442 F Supp 383). On appeals, the United States Court of Appeals for the District of Columbia Circuit affirmed the trial court's judgment ordering production of records of phone conversations made by the Secretary of State while he served in that office and holding that the summaries made during his service as National Security Advisor did not have to be produced, the Court of Appeals reasoning with regard to such summaries that the Freedom of Information Act does not cover presidential advisers who are so close to the President as to be within the White House and that relocation of the records from White House files to the State Department did not bring them within the State Department's disclosure responsibility under the Freedom of Information Act (191 App DC 213, 589 F2d 1116).",lexis
"A female employee of the Texas Department of Community Affairs brought an action against the Department in the United States District Court for the Western District of Texas, alleging that the Department's failure to promote her and its subsequent decision to terminate her employment had been predicated on gender discrimination in violation of Title VII of the Civil Rights Act of 1964 (42 USCS 2000e et seq.). After a bench trial, the District Court held that neither decision was based on gender discrimination, the court relying on testimony that the decisions were based on consultation among trusted advisors and on a nondiscriminatory evaluation of the relative qualifications of the individuals involved and that the Department thought that it could improve efficiency by terminating the employee and two others who did not work well together. On appeal, the United States Court of Appeals for the Fifth Circuit affirmed the District Court's decision that the employee was not discriminated against when she was not promoted, but reversed the District Court's finding that the Department's testimony sufficiently had rebutted the employee's prima facie case of gender discrimination in the decision to terminate her employment, the court reaffirming its previously announced views that the defendant in a Title VII case bears the burden of proving by a preoponderance of the evidence the existence of legitimate, nondiscriminatory reasons for the employment action and that the defendant also must prove by objective evidence that those hired or promoted were better qualified than the plaintiff, and finding that the Department had not met either of these evidentiary burdens on the discharge issue (608 F2d 563).",lexis
"Passengers could be ordered to get out during a traffic stop and the interest in officer safety allowed for patdowns for weapons if the officer reasonably concluded the passenger could be armed and dangerous. Respondent was lawfully detained incident to the valid stop of the car in which he was a passenger. It was unrealistic to characterize the officer/respondent interaction as ""consensual."" The encounter took place within minutes of the stop, the patdown followed within moments of respondent's exit from the car, and the point at which he could have felt free to leave had not yet occurred. The officer's inquiries into gang activity matters, unrelated to the justification for the traffic stop, did not convert the encounter into something other than a lawful seizure, since the inquiries did not measurably extend the stop's duration. Nothing could have conveyed to respondent that, prior to the frisk, the stop had ended or that he was otherwise free to leave without permission. The officer was not constitutionally required to give him an opportunity to leave after he exited the car without first ensuring that, in so doing, she was not permitting a dangerous person to get behind her.",lexis
"The accused, who was charged with murder, repeatedly told his attorney that although he had not actually seen a gun in the victim's hand when he stabbed the victim, he was convinced that the victim had a gun. No gun was found on the premises where the victim was stabbed, and the accused's companions who were present during the stabbing told the accused's attorney that they had seen no gun. Shortly before trial, the accused told the attorney for the first time that he had actually seen ""something metallic"" in the victim's hand, and that ""if I don't say I saw a gun, I'm dead."" The attorney advised the accused that the claim of self-defense could be based on the accused's reasonable belief that the victim had a gun; that it was not necessary to prove that the victim actually had a gun; that the attorney would not allow the accused to commit perjury; that the attorney would probably impeach the accused's testimony that the victim actually had a gun; and that the attorney would seek to withdraw from representing the accused if the accused insisted on committing perjury. At the accused's jury trial, in an Iowa state court, the accused testified that he believed that the victim had a gun, but he admitted that he had not actually seen a gun. After the jury returned a verdict of second-degree murder, the accused moved for a new trial on the ground that he had been deprived of a fair trial by the attorney's admonitions not to state that he saw a gun or ""something metallic."" The accused's motion for a new trial was denied, and the Supreme Court of Iowa affirmed the accused's conviction, holding that the attorney had properly refused to help the accused commit perjury (272 NW2d 468). The accused then petitioned for a writ of habeas corpus in the United States District Court for the Southern District of Iowa, and the District Court, denying the writ, held that there could be no ground for habeas corpus relief because there was no constitutional right to present a perjured defense. Reversing the District Court's decision and directing that the writ of habeas corpus be granted, the United States Court of Appeals for the Eighth Circuit held (1) that the attorney's threat to withdraw and to inform the court of the accused's perjury had impermissibly compromised the accused's Sixth Amendment right to effective assistance of counsel, and (2) that the attorney's conduct was presumptively prejudicial to the accused's defense (744 F2d 1323).

"A state prisoner serving a sentence of life imprisonment following his conviction of first-degree manslaughter filed a petition for a writ of habeas corpus in the United States District Court for the District of South Dakota, alleging that his statements to police were improperly admitted at his trial because, although the prisoner had been given his Miranda warnings, the police had resumed questioning after the prisoner had invoked his right to counsel, though his attorney was not present, and it was during such subsequent questioning that the incriminating statements were made. The District Court denied the writ after an evidentiary hearing, concluding that the prisoner had knowingly, intelligently, and voluntarily waived his right to counsel. While the prisoner's appeal to the Court of Appeals for the Eighth Circuit was pending, the Supreme Court decided Edwards v Arizona (1981) 451 US 477, 68 L Ed 2d 378, 101 S Ct 1880, in which it held that once a suspect has invoked the right to counsel, any subsequent conversation must be initiated by him.

"Four persons who had assaulted undercover narcotics agents posing as narcotics buyers were indicted for violating 18 USCS 111, which makes it a criminal offense to assault, resist, or interfere with certain federal officers in the performance of their official duties, and for conspiring to commit such assault, in violation of the general conspiracy statute (18 USCS 371). Upon trial in the United States District Court for the Southern District of New York, the trial court instructed the jury that in order to convict on either the conspiracy count or the substantive count, the government was not required to prove that the defendants knew that the assault victims were federal agents. The defendants were convicted on both counts. The United States Court of Appeals for the Second Circuit affirmed the convictions on the substantive charges, but reversed the conspiracy convictions, holding that while the defendants' knowledge of the victims' official status was not required to be established as to the substantive charge, nevertheless the failure to instruct the jury that such knowledge must be proved to convict on the conspiracy charge constituted plain error (486 F2d 1339).",lexis
"A class action on behalf of certain Texas school children was instituted against state school authorities in the United States District Court for the Western District of Texas, the plaintiffs challenging the constitutionality, under the equal protection clause of the Fourteenth Amendment, of the state's statutory system for financing public education which authorizes an ad valorem tax by each school district on property within the district to supplement educational funds received by each district from the state, and which thus results in substantial interdistrict disparities in per-pupil expenditures attributable chiefly to the differences in amounts received through local property taxation because of variations in the amount of taxable properties within each district. The three-judge District Court held that the Texas school financing system discriminated on the basis of wealth and was unconstitutional under the equal protection clause, ruling that (1) wealth was a suspect classification, and education was a fundamental interest, thus requiring the state to show, under the strict judicial scrutiny test, a compelling state interest for its system, which the state had failed to do, and (2) in any event, the state had failed to establish even a reasonable basis for its system (337 F Supp 280).",lexis
"In 1920, the Sioux Indian Nation--upon passage of a special jurisdictional act granting them a mechanism to litigate longstanding claims--brought suit in the United States Court of Claims against the United States, alleging that the government had taken the Black Hills from them without just compensation in violation of the Fifth Amendment. The United States, under the Fort Laramie Treaty of 1868 (15 Stat 635), had originally pledged that the Great Sioux Reservation, including the Black Hills, would be set aside for the absolute and undisturbed use and occupation of the Sioux. The treaty also provided that no treaty for the cession of any portion of the reservation would be valid unless signed by at least three fourths of the adult male Sioux. In 1876, a special Commission representing the United States presented a new treaty to the Sioux under which the Sioux were to relinquish their rights to the Black Hills in exchange for subsistence rations for as long as they would be needed to ensure survival of the Sioux. The treaty was signed by only ten percent of the adult male Sioux population, but Congress resolved the impasse in 1877 by enacting the ""agreement"" into law (19 Stat 254), thereby abrogating the Fort Laramie Treaty. In 1942, the Court of Claims dismissed the claim of the Sioux, concluding that it was not authorized to question whether the compensation afforded the Sioux by Congress in 1877 was an adequate price for the Black Hills, and that the claim of the Sioux was a moral claim not protected by the just compensation clause of the Fifth Amendment. Congress then passed, in 1946, the Indian Claims Commission Act (25 USCS 70 et seq.), creating a new forum to hear and determine all previous tribal grievances. The Sioux resubmitted their claim to the Indian Claims Commission, which ultimately held that the 1942 Court of Claims decision did not bar the Indians' Fifth Amendment taking claim through application of the doctrine of res judicata, and that the government was required to pay the Indians just compensation for the taking of the Black Hills. On appeal, the Court of Claims affirmed the Commission's holding that the government had acquired the Black Hills through a course of unfair and dishonest dealings for which the Sioux were entitled to damages of over $ 17 million, without interest, under 2 of the Indian Claims Commission Act (25 USCS 70a(5)), but, without reaching the merits of the claim, the court held that the just compensation claim was barred by the res judicata effect of its 1942 decision. According to the court, the Sioux would be entitled to interest only if the government's acquisition of the Black Hills amounted to an unconstitutional taking. Congress thereupon passed a statute in 1978 (25 USCS 70a(b)) authorizing the Court of Claims to take new evidence in the case, and to conduct its review of the merits de novo without regard to the defense of res judicata. Applying the test of whether Congress had made a good faith effort to give the Indians the full value of their land, the Court of Claims affirmed the Commission's holding that the 1877 Act effected a taking of the Black Hills, and awarded to the Sioux interest of five percent on the principal sum of $ 17.1 million, dating from 1877.

"The New York City Board of Estimate--which managed city property, granted city contracts, exercised zoning authority, and shared with the City Council the power to modify and approve budgets proposed by the mayor--was composed of the following officials, who became members of the Board by law upon their election to office: (1) the city's mayor, the comptroller, and the city council president, each of whom was elected citywide and cast two votes on the Board, except that the mayor did not participate in the Board's budget decisions; and (2) the presidents of the city's five boroughs, each of whom cast one vote. Registered voters from Brooklyn, the most populous of the boroughs, filed an action in the United States District Court for the Eastern District of New York against the city, the Board, and the Board members, in which action the voters (1) alleged that the composition of the Board violated the ""one person, one vote"" rule established under the equal protection clause of the Fourteenth Amendment, because giving equal voting power to the presidents of boroughs with widely varying populations diluted the voting rights of Brooklyn residents; and (2) sought declaratory and injunctive relief. The District Court granted summary judgment for the defendants, on the ground that the Board was not subject to the ""one person, one vote"" rule because (1) it did not exercise legislative authority, and (2) its members were not elected as such but were in effect appointed after their election to separate offices (551 F Supp 652). The United States Court of Appeals for the Second Circuit reversed and remanded for further proceedings, as it held that the Board must conform to the ""one person, one vote"" rule because all of its members are ultimately selected by popular vote (707 F2d 686). On remand, the District Court held that the Board should be evaluated on the basis of the maximum population deviation between the largest and smallest districts--a 132.9 percent deviation between Brooklyn and Staten Island--without any modification to account for the three at-large members (592 F Supp 1462); and in a separate decision, the District Court (1) ruled that none of the explanations offered by the city required or justified this gross deviation from equal representation, and (2) granted summary judgment in favor of the plaintiff voters (647 F Supp 1463). The Court of Appeals, affirming, rejected the city's argument that discrepancies between election districts should be analyzed by applying the so-called Banzhaf Index, which focuses not on population but on calculating the power of individual voters to cast the deciding vote in the election of a representative who can cast the deciding vote on the governmental body in question (831 F2d 384).",lexis

The coach commenced a defamation action in the Court of Common Pleas of Lake County, Ohio against the author of the article and the owner of the newspaper in which it was published, alleging that various passages in the article, and the headline appearing above it, (1) accused him of committing the crime of perjury, (2) damaged him in his occupation as a coach and teacher, and (3) constituted libel per se. The court granted a directed verdict for the defense on the ground that the evidence failed to establish that the article was published with ""actual malice."" The Ohio Court of Appeals for the Eleventh Appellate District reversed and remanded, holding that there was sufficient evidence of actual malice to permit the case to go to the jury. On remand, the trial court granted summary judgment for the defense on the grounds that (1) the article was an opinion protected from a libel action by ""constitutional law,"" and alternatively, (2) as a public figure, the coach had failed to make a prima facie case of actual malice. The Ohio Court of Appeals affirmed both rulings, but the Supreme Court of Ohio reversed and remanded, holding that (1) the coach was neither a public figure nor a public official under the relevant law, and (2) the allegedly defamatory statements were factual assertions as a matter of law and were not constitutionally protected as the opinions of the author. Meanwhile, the public school superintendent had been pursuing a separate defamation action in the Ohio courts, based on the same newspaper article.

Notwithstanding that the school district did not require attendance at graduation as a condition for receipt of a diploma, the student and her family attended the graduation, where the prayers were recited. The father subsequently filed an amended complaint seeking a permanent injunction to bar various officials of the city's public schools from inviting the clergy to deliver such prayers at future graduations. The District Court granted the injunction on the ground that the school officials' actions endorsed religion and thus violated the establishment of religion clause of the Federal Constitution's First Amendment (728 F Supp 68). The United States Court of Appeals for the First Circuit affirmed (908 F2d 1090).",lexis
"After the failure of a Maryland savings and loan association, a deposit insurance fund corporation was appointed as receiver of the association and brought suit in the Circuit Court for Baltimore City against various parties, including the former officers and directors of the association. Also, class actions by depositors were brought against the association and its principals in the Circuit Court. In addition, holders of unpaid certificates of deposit issued by the association brought suit against the association in United States District Court and alleged various state-law causes of action, as well as civil claims under the Racketeer Influenced and Corrupt Organizations Act (RICO) (18 USCS 1961-1968) and under federal securities legislation. The District Court, granting the defendants' motion to dismiss, held that (1) the plaintiffs had failed to state a claim under federal securities legislation, and (2) because state courts have concurrent jurisdiction over civil RICO claims, federal abstention was appropriate for the other causes of action, since they had been raised in the pending litigation in the Circuit Court. After this decision by the District Court, the plaintiffs filed a class action against the defendants in the Circuit Court and alleged RICO and common-law causes of action. The United States Court of Appeals for the Fourth Circuit, affirming the District Court's decision, expressed approval of the District Court's abstention from deciding the plaintiffs' RICO claims (865 F2d 595).",lexis
"To satisfy customer needs, the competitor modified its design for an adjustable pedal system for vehicles with cable-actuated throttles by adding a modular sensor to make the system compatible with vehicles using computer-controlled throttles. The licensees contended that the competitor infringed the patent claim of a position-adjustable pedal assembly with an electronic pedal position sensor attached a fixed pivot point. The U.S. Supreme Court unanimously held that the patent claim was invalid as obvious since mounting an available sensor on a fixed pivot point of the competitor's pedal was a design step well within the grasp of a person of ordinary skill in the relevant art, and the benefit of doing so was obvious. The marketplace created a strong incentive to convert mechanical pedals to electronic pedals, and the prior art taught a number of methods for doing so. Further, the problem to be solved by the patent claim did not limit its application as prior art, the competitor's showing that it was obvious to try a combination of elements sufficiently supported the finding of obviousness, and the claim was the result of ordinary skill and common sense rather than innovation.",lexis
"A newspaper editor who published an advertisement of an organization located in another state which offered services related to obtaining legal abortions in the state where the organization was located, was convicted in the County Court of Albemarle County, Virginia, of violating a Virginia statute which, at that time, made it a misdemeanor, by the sale or circulation of any publication, to encourage or prompt the procuring of an abortion. The editor appealed to the Circuit Court of that county, and, on trial de novo, he was again convicted. The Supreme Court of Virginia affirmed, holding, inter alia, that as to the editor's First Amendment claim, the advertisement was a commercial one which could be constitutionally prohibited by the state, particularly since the advertising related to the medical-health field, and that as to his claim of overbreadth, since he lacked a legitimate First Amendment interest, he had no standing to rely upon the hypothetical rights of those in the noncommercial zone (213 Va 191, 191 SE2d 173). Thereafter, the editor appealed to the United States Supreme Court which vacated the judgment of conviction and remanded the case for further consideration in the light of its intervening decisions as to the constitutionality of state abortion laws (413 US 909, 37 L Ed 2d 1020, 93 S Ct 3057).

The Court determined that the employer was not entitled to judgment as a matter of law regarding the employee's ""cat's paw"" discrimination claim under the USERRA because (1) both supervisors were acting within the scope of their employment when they took the actions that allegedly caused the vice president to fire the employee, (2) there was evidence that the supervisors' actions were motivated by hostility toward his military obligations, (3) there was evidence that the supervisors' actions were causal factors underlying the vice president's decision to fire him, and (4) there was evidence that both supervisors had the specific intent to cause him to be terminated.",lexis

At issue were the questions whether there was federal-court subject-matter jurisdiction over his complaint, and whether his Fourteenth Amendment claim was cognizable under ¬¨√ü 1983. The Rooker-Feldman doctrine did not bar his suit because he did not challenge the adverse state court decisions themselves; instead, he targeted as unconstitutional the Texas statute they authoritatively construed.

"Petitioners alleged an inadequate response to peer-on-peer sexual harassment, and they raised a claim under _ 1983 for violation of the Equal Protection Clause under U.S. Const. amend. XIV. The court of appeals held that Title IX's implied private remedy was sufficiently comprehensive to preclude the use of _ 1983 to advance constitutional claims and to advance statutory claims based on Title IX. The Court, however, did not agree that Congress saw Title IX as the sole means of vindicating the constitutional right to be free from gender discrimination perpetuated by educational institutions. In light of the divergent coverage of Title IX and the Equal Protection Clause, as well as the absence of a comprehensive remedial scheme comparable to those at issue in Sea Clammers, Smith, and Rancho Palos Verdes, the Court concluded that Title IX was not meant to be an exclusive mechanism for addressing gender discrimination in schools or a substitute for _ 1983 suits as a means of enforcing constitutional rights.

"Upon trial in an Alabama court, the defendant was convicted of violating an ordinance which made it an offense to participate in any parade or public demonstration without having first obtained a permit from city authorities, the defendant having participated in a civil rights march for which a request for a permit had been denied. The ordinance authorized the members of the city commission to refuse a permit if required to by ""public welfare, peace, safety, health, decency, good order, morals or convenience."" The Court of Appeals of Alabama reversed the conviction, holding that the ordinance had been applied in a discriminatory fashion, and that it was unconstitutional as imposing a prior restraint without ascertainable standards for the granting of permits (43 Ala App 68, 180 So 2d 114). However, the Supreme Court of Alabama reversed and reinstated the conviction, construing the ordinance as not authorizing the refusal of a permit solely on the ground that disorderly conduct might be provoked by the parade or demonstration, and as requiring that applications for permits be granted if it was found that the convenience of the public in the use of the streets or sidewalks would not thereby be unduly disturbed (281 Ala 542, 206 So 2d 348).",lexis

The term ""violent felony"" is defined, under 924(e), as any crime punishable by imprisonment for a term exceeding one year that (1) has as an element the use of physical force against another person, or (2) is a ""burglary"" or other specified offense ""or otherwise involves conduct that presents a serious potential risk of physical injury to another.""

"In response to the international crisis precipitated by the seizure of the United States Embassy in Tehran, Iran, and the capture of United States diplomatic personnel, President Carter, acting pursuant to the International Emergency Economic Powers Act (50 USCS 1701 et seq.), declared a national emergency on November 14, 1979, and blocked the removal or transfer of all property and interests of the government of Iran, its instrumentalities and controlled entities and the Central Bank of Iran which were or would become subject to the jurisdiction of the United States. Regulations were then issued by the Department of Treasury's Office of Foreign Assets Control providing, among other things, that ""[u]nless licensed or authorized ... any attachment, judgment, decree, lien, execution, garnishment, or other judicial processes is null and void with respect to any property in which on or since [November 14, 1979,] there existed an interest of Iran"" ( 31 CFR 535.203(e)), the regulations making clear that any licenses or authorizations granted could be ""amended, modified, or revoked at any time"" ( 31 CFR 535.805). Subsequently, the President granted a general license authorizing certain judicial proceedings against Iran but which did not allow the entry of any judgment or any decree ( 31 CFR 535.504(a)), and later a clarifying regulation was issued stating that ""the general authorization for judicial proceedings contained in 535.504(a) includes pre-judgment attachment"" ( 31 CFR 535.418). On December 19, 1979, a corporation filed suit in the United States District Court for the Central District of California against the government of Iran, the Atomic Energy Organization of Iran, and a number of Iranian banks, alleging that the corporation's wholly owned subsidiary was party to a written contract with the Atomic Energy Organization, that the subsidiary's entire interest in the contract had been assigned to the corporation, and that although the contract had been properly terminated by Atomic Energy Organization, the corporation was owed for services performed under the contract prior to the date of termination. The District Court issued orders of attachment directed against property of the defendants, and the property of certain Iranian banks was then attached to secure any judgment that might be entered against them. On January 20, 1981, the Americans held hostage were released by Iran pursuant to agreements entered into with the United States which, among other things, called for the establishment of an Iran-United States Claims Tribunal which would arbitrate any claims not settled within six months and under which the United States was obligated to terminate all legal proceedings in the United States courts involving claims against Iran and its state enterprises, to nullify all attachments and judgments obtained therein, to prohibit all further litigation based on such claims, and to bring about the termination of such claims through binding arbitration, and act to bring about the transfer of all Iranian assets held in the United States by United States banks. On January 19, 1981, President Carter issued a series of Executive Orders implementing the terms of the Agreement, revoking all licenses permitting the exercise of ""any right, power, or privilege"" with regard to Iranian funds, securities, or deposits, nullifying all non-Iranian interests in such assets acquired subsequent to the blocking order of November 14, 1979, and requiring those banks holding Iranian assets to transfer them to the Federal Reserve Bank of New York, and on February 24, 1981, President Reagan issued an Executive Order in which he ""ratified"" the prior Executive Orders and ""suspended"" all ""claims which may be presented to the ... Tribunal"" and provided that such claims ""shall have no legal affect in any action now pending in any court of the United States."" Meanwhile, on January 27, 1981, the corporation moved for summary judgment in the District Court against the Iranian governmental defendants, but not against the Iranian banks, and the District Court granted the motion and awarded the corporation the amount claimed under the contract plus interest. The corporation attempted to execute the judgment by obtaining writs of garnishment and execution in Washington state courts and a sheriff's sale of Iranian property in Washington was noticed to satisfy the judgment. However, the District Court stayed execution of its judgment pending appeal by the governmental defendants, and ordered that all prejudgment attachments obtained against the Iranian defendants be vacated and that further proceedings against the bank defendants be stayed in light of the Executive Orders. The corporation then filed an action in the District Court against the United States and the Secretary of the Treasury for declaratory and injunctive relief, seeking to prevent enforcement of the Executive Orders and regulations implementing the agreements and alleging that the actions of the President and the Secretary implementing the agreements were beyond their statutory and constitutional power and, in any event, were unconstitutional to the extent they adversely affected the corporation's final judgment against the Iranian governmental defendants, its execution of that judgment in state courts, its prejudgment attachments, and its ability to continue to litigate against the Iranian banks. The District Court denied the corporation's motion for a preliminary injunction and dismissed its complaint for failure to state a claim upon which relief could be granted. The corporation filed a notice of appeal from the District Court's order, and the appeal was docketed in the United States Court of Appeals for the Ninth Circuit. On the following day, the Treasury Department amended its regulations to mandate ""the transfer of bank deposits and certain other financial assets of Iran in the United States to the Federal Reserve Bank of New York by noon, June 19,"" but the District Court entered an injunction pending appeal prohibiting the United States from requiring the transfer of Iranian property that is subject to any writ of attachment, garnishment, judgment, levy, or other judicial liens issued by any court in favor of the corporation.",lexis
"Police officers who were summoned to a Chicago, Illinois residence were met by a woman who showed signs of having been severely beaten. In a conversation with the officers, the woman stated that she had been assaulted by the accused earlier in the day at an apartment on another Chicago street, and that the accused was asleep at the apartment. Several times during the conversation, the woman referred to the apartment as ""our"" apartment, and she said that she had clothes and furniture there. The woman consented to travel to the apartment with the officers in order to unlock the door with her key so that the officers could enter and arrest the accused. Without obtaining either an arrest warrant for the accused or a search warrant for the apartment, the officers drove to the apartment, accompanied by the woman. Once there, the woman unlocked the door with her key and gave the officers permission to enter. The officers entered and observed in plain view drug paraphernalia and containers filled with a white powder that they believed--and that later analysis showed--to be cocaine. Proceeding to the bedroom, the officers found the accused asleep and discovered additional containers of white powder in two open attache cases. The officers arrested the accused and seized the drugs and related paraphernalia. The accused, who was charged in the Circuit Court of Cook County, Illinois with possession of a controlled substance with intent to deliver, moved to suppress all evidence seized at the time of his arrest, on the ground that the woman had vacated the apartment several weeks earlier and had no authority to consent to the officers' entry. The circuit court, granting the motion, ruled that (1) at the time she consented to the entry, the woman did not have common authority over the apartment, since she was an ""infrequent visitor"" at the apartment, rather than a ""usual resident,"" and (2) the Federal Constitution's Fourth Amendment was violated even if the officers reasonably believed at the time of their entry that the woman possessed the authority to consent.

"In 1956, the Bureau of Public Roads approved a route for construction of an interstate highway in Memphis, Tennessee, which route would have destroyed 26 acres of a 342-acre park located near the center of Memphis and which would have severed that portion of the park containing the zoo from the remainder of the park, which contained a golf course, an art academy, 170 acres of forest, and other recreational areas. This route was again approved in 1966 by the Federal Highway Administrator. However, in 1966, Congress passed the Department of Transportation Act, 4(f) of which declared it to be the national policy that special effort should be made to preserve, inter alia, public park and recreation lands and which ordered the Secretary of Transportation not to approve any program or project which required the use of any publicly owned land from a public park or recreation area unless (1) there was no feasible and prudent alternative to the use of such land, and (2) there was included in any such program all possible planning to minimize harm to any park or recreational area used for such purposes. The state continued to acquire rights of way on both sides of the park, and, after the Secretary of Transportation announced in 1968 that he concurred in the judgment of local officials that the highway should be built through the park, the state in 1969 acquired the right of way inside the park from the city. Final approval of the route and design for the road was not announced until late in 1969 after Congress had reiterated in 138 of the Federal- Aid Highway Act of 1968 that highway construction through public parks was to be restricted. The announcements approving the route and design of the highway were not accompanied by formal findings of fact, nor did the Secretary state why he believed there were no feasible and prudent alternative routes or why design changes could not be made to reduce harm to the park. Petitioners, a group of private citizens and local and national conservation organizations, brought suit in the United States District Court for the Western District of Tennessee, seeking to halt construction of the highway through the park and arguing that (1) the Secretary's action in approving the route and design was invalid without formal findings, (2) the Secretary made no independent determination but relied on the judgment of local officials as to the route selected, (3) there were feasible and prudent alternative routes for the highway both north and south of the park, and (4) the design plans did not include ""all possible"" methods for reducing harm to the park. The District Court held that the statutes did not require the Secretary to file formal findings, and, construing its review powers narrowly, decided that the Secretary had not exceeded his authority in approving the route. Therefore, it granted defendants' motion for summary judgment and dismissed the action (309 F Supp 1189).

The District Court denied the motion to suppress, and the defendant was convicted. However, the United States Court for the Ninth Circuit reversed, holding that (1) even though there was probable cause for the arrest, the Fourth Amendment was violated because the officers had failed to obtain a warrant when they could have done so, and (2) based on the totality of the circumstances, including the illegal arrest, the defendant's consent to the search had been coerced (504 F2d 849).",lexis
"The prospective purchasers of a beachfront lot, which was located between two public beaches, sought to satisfy a condition on their option to purchase by tearing down an old bungalow on the premises and replacing it with a larger house, and sought a permit for such a development of the property from the California Coastal Commission (CCC) as required by state law. The CCC granted the permit on the condition that the purchasers give the public an easement to pass across the portion of the property which lay between the mean high tide line, which defined the seaward edge of the property, and a seawall. The purchasers petitioned the Superior Court of Ventura County, California, for a writ of administrative mandamus to invalidate that condition, and the Superior Court, finding that such a condition could not be imposed absent evidence that the proposed development of the property would have a direct adverse impact on public access to the beach, remanded the case to the CCC for an evidentiary hearing on that issue. After holding such a hearing, the CCC (1) found that the new house would restrict public access to the beach by (a) increasing blockage of the public view of the beach and thus ""psychologically"" inhibiting the public's recognition of its right of access and (b) increasing private use of the shorefront; and accordingly (2) reaffirmed the permit condition. The purchasers, contending that the imposition of that condition constituted a taking of private property without just compensation in violation of the Fifth Amendment, filed a supplemental petition with the Superior Court. The Superior Court then (1) determined that the administrative record did not show that the new house would create a direct or cumulative burden on public access to the sea, (2) concluded that the CCC had exceeded its statutory authority in imposing the access condition, and (3) ordered the CCC to issue the permit without that condition. The new house was thereafter built, and the sale of the property consummated. However, the California Court of Appeal subsequently ruled that there was substantial evidence to support the decision of the CCC, and accordingly reversed the judgment of the Superior Court and remanded with instructions to deny the petition for a writ of mandate (117 Cal App 3d 719, 223 Cal Rptr 28).",lexis

"The National Railroad Passenger Corporation (Amtrak), a private, for-profit corporation created by the Rail Passenger Service Act of 1970 (45 USCS 501 et seq.), operates passenger trains, generally on existing tracks owned and used by freight railroads, through means including ""trackage rights"" agreements. In addition, under 45 USCS 562(d)(1), if a railroad and Amtrak are unable to agree upon terms for the sale to Amtrak of railroad property ""required"" for intercity rail passenger service, Amtrak may apply to the Interstate Commerce Commission (ICC) for an order establishing Amtrak's need for the property and requiring the conveyance of the property from the railroad to Amtrak on reasonable terms and conditions, including just compensation. Pursuant to 562(d)(1), Amtrak's need for the property is deemed to be established, unless the ICC finds that (1) conveyance of the property to Amtrak would significantly impair the railroad's ability to carry out its obligations as a common carrier; and (2) Amtrak's obligation to provide rail passenger service can adequately be met by the acquisition of alternative property. When Amtrak became dissatisfied with a railroad's maintenance of a 48.8-mile segment of track used by an Amtrak passenger service, Amtrak reached a preliminary agreement with a second railroad which owned other parts of the same line, to the effect that (1) Amtrak would acquire the segment in question, reconvey the segment to the second railroad, and provide some funds for upgrading and rehabilitation; while (2) the second railroad would provide the balance of the upgrade funds, maintain the track, and grant trackage rights to Amtrak and the first railroad. Amtrak then made a purchase offer to the first railroad, but when Amtrak interpreted a response as a rejection, Amtrak instituted ICC proceedings. Eventually, the ICC--in issuing a final decision which ordered the segment's conveyance to Amtrak, with just compensation to the first railroad of more than $ 2.3 million--expressed the view, in the ICC's first decided case involving condemnation powers under 562(d), that (1) Amtrak had met the statutory conditions for the institution of proceedings; and (2) the first railroad had established neither of the two statutory criteria to rebut the statutory presumption of need. On petition for review, the United States Court of Appeals for the District of Columbia Circuit--in granting the petition and in ordering a remand for further proceedings--expressed the view that 562(d) did not permit Amtrak to condemn railroad property which Amtrak intended to convey to another railroad, for no deference was due to the ICC's contrary interpretation, as 562(d) was unambiguous in light of its language and history (286 App DC 1, 911 F2d 743). While rehearing was pending, Congress in 1990, in specific response to the Court of Appeals' decision, added to 562(d)(1) a provision to the effect that Amtrak may subsequently convey title or other interest in acquired property to a third party, if the reconveyance is found by the ICC to further the purposes of the statute (PL 101-641, 9(a)); this amendment was made applicable to all pending cases (PL 101-641, 9(b)). The Court of Appeals, however, in denying rehearing, expressed the view that, while the 1990 addition made it clear that Amtrak was authorized to reconvey property subsequent to a condemnation that was otherwise valid under 562(d), the addition did not change the 562(d) limitation that the property be ""required"" in the first place (288 App DC 196, 925 F2d 427).",lexis

"The Board of Airport Commissioners of the City of Los Angeles adopted a resolution declaring that the central terminal area at Los Angeles International Airport was not open for ""First Amendment activities"" by any individual or entity. Pursuant to the resolution, a Department of Airports peace officer stopped a minister, who was affiliated with a nonprofit religious corporation, from distributing free religious literature in the central terminal area. The officer explained to the minister that his activities were in violation of the resolution and requested him to leave the terminal, warning that the city would take legal action against him if he refused to leave. The minister complied with the request. The minister and the religious corporation filed an action in the United States District Court for the Central District of California, challenging the constitutionality of the resolution under both the California and Federal Constitutions, and seeking a declaration of their rights to distribute religious literature in the central terminal area. The District Court, granting summary judgment to the plaintiffs, held that the central terminal area was a traditional public forum and that the resolution was facially unconstitutional under the Federal Constitution.

"In United States v Chadwick (1977) 433 US 1, 53 L Ed 2d 538, 97 S Ct 2476, the United States Supreme Court held that a warrantless search by police of a locked footlocker violated the Federal Constitution's Fourth Amendment, notwithstanding that the police had probable cause to believe that the footlocker contained marijuana. Subsequently, in Arkansas v Sanders (1979) 442 US 753, 61 L Ed 2d 235, 99 S Ct 2586, the court held that the Fourth Amendment requires the police to obtain a search warrant to search a closed container found in an automobile even though there is probable cause to believe the container contains contraband. However, in United States v Ross (1982) 456 US 798, 72 L Ed 2d 572, 102 S Ct 2157, the Supreme Court held that a warrantless search of an automobile under the rule adopted in Carroll v United States (1925) 267 US 132, 69 L Ed 543, 45 S Ct 280--that a warrantless search of an automobile based upon probable cause to believe that the vehicle contains evidence of crime in the light of an exigency arising out of the likely disappearance of the vehicle does not contravene the Fourth Amendment--could include a search of a container found inside the automobile when the search of the automobile was supported by probable cause. A package known by police officers to contain marijuana was picked up at a Federal Express office in California by the package's addressee and taken to an apartment. Before a search warrant was obtained, a man entered the apartment, stayed for about 10 minutes, and left the apartment carrying a brown paper bag that looked full and was the size of one of the marijuana packages which had been contained in the Federal Express package. The man placed the paper bag in the trunk of an automobile and started to drive the automobile away. Police officers, fearing the loss of evidence, stopped the automobile, opened the trunk and the paper bag, and found marijuana. The man was charged in a California state court with possession of marijuana for sale and moved to suppress the marijuana found in the bag. His motion was denied, and he pleaded guilty but appealed the denial of the suppression motion. On appeal, the California Court of Appeal, Fourth District, ruled that (1) the police had probable cause to believe that the paper bag contained drugs, but lacked probable cause to suspect that the man's automobile otherwise contained contraband; (2) because the officers' probable cause was directed specifically at the bag, the case was controlled by United States v Chadwick rather than by United States v Ross; and (3) the marijuana found in the paper bag should have been suppressed (216 Cal App 3d 586, 265 Cal Rptr 23).

"Under the Commodity Exchange Act (7 USCS 1 et seq.), any person complaining of a violation of the Act by a registered commodity futures broker may apply to the Commodity Futures Trading Commission (CFTC) for an order directing the broker to pay reparations to the complainant and may enforce that order in a Federal District Court (7 USCS 18). Under a regulation of the CFTC, it may adjudicate counterclaims arising out of the transaction or occurrence or series of transactions or occurrences set forth in the complaint. Certain customers of a commodity futures broker filed complaints with the CFTC against the broker and one of its employees, claiming that the customers' debit balance in their account with the broker was the result of the broker's numerous violations of the Act. Meanwhile, the broker filed suit in the United States District Court for the Northern District of Illinois against these customers to recover the debit balance, which suit the customers moved to dismiss on the ground that the reparations proceedings would fully resolve all the rights of the parties. The broker voluntarily dismissed the federal court action and presented its debit balance claim by way of a counterclaim in the reparations proceeding. The administrative law judge in the reparations proceeding ruled in favor of the broker on the customers' claims and the broker's counterclaims, and when the customers for the first time challenged the CFTC's statutory authority to adjudicate the broker's counterclaim, the administrative law judge rejected the challenge, and the CFTC declined to review the decision and allowed it to become final. On appeal, the United States Court of Appeals for the District of Columbia Circuit upheld the CFTC's decision on the customers' claims in most respects, but ordered the dismissal of the broker's counterclaims on the ground that the CFTC lacked authority or subject matter competence to adjudicate common-law counterclaims, because the Act authorized the CFTC to adjudicate only those counterclaims alleging violations of the Act or CFTC regulations (239 App DC 159, 740 F2d 1262). The Court of Appeals denied rehearing en banc. The United States Supreme Court (473 US 923, 87 L Ed 2d 674, 105 S Ct 3551) granted the CFTC's petition for certiorari, vacated the Court of Appeals' judgment, and remanded the case for further consideration in light of Thomas v Union Carbide Agricultural Products Co.

Gen. Laws ch. 111, _ 13. The U.S. Supreme Court held that admission of the certificates violated petitioner's Sixth Amendment right to confront the witnesses against him. The certificates were affidavits, which fell within the core class of testimonial statements covered by the Confrontation Clause, and they were made under circumstances which would have led an objective witness reasonably to believe that they were made for use in a criminal trial.

"In Bivens v Six Unknown Named Agents of Federal Bureau of Narcotics (1971) 403 US 388, 29 L Ed 2d 619, 91 S Ct 1999, the United States Supreme Court established that, in certain circumstances, the violation of a provision of the United States Constitution can give rise to an action for damages against the individual offending federal officers even in the absence of a statute authorizing such relief, but, in Chappell v Wallace (1983) 462 US 296, 76 L Ed 2d 586, 103 S Ct 2362, the Supreme Court ruled that it was inappropriate--due to the special factors involved--to provide enlisted military personnel with a Bivens-type remedy against their superior officers. In 1958, a United States Army master sergeant volunteered to participate in a testing program--ostensibly for chemical warfare defense--in which the sergeant was instead secretly administered doses of lysergic acid diethylamide (LSD), in order to study the effects of the drug on human subjects. As a result of the LSD exposure, the sergeant allegedly suffered personality changes, hallucinations, periods of incoherence and memory loss, the impairment of his military performance, and the dissolution of his marriage. After the sergeant had been discharged from the Army, and had had his administrative claims for compensation denied, the former sergeant filed suit in the United States District Court for the Southern District of Florida under the Federal Tort Claims Act (FTCA) (28 USCS 2671 et seq.), alleging negligence in the administration, supervision, and subsequent monitoring of the drug testing program, but the District Court granted a motion in favor of the defendant Federal Government, expressing the view that the sergeant's FTCA suit was barred because his participation in the drug-testing program was incident to his military service. On appeal, the United States Court of Appeals for the Fifth Circuit--in 1981, prior to the decision in Chappell v Wallace--(1) agreed that the incident-to-service doctrine barred the sergeant's FTCA suit; but (2) concluding that the sergeant had at least a colorable constitutional claim under Bivens, remanded the case to the District Court for consideration of any amendment the sergeant might offer (639 F2d 1146). On remand, after the sergeant had filed a second amended complaint which asserted a Bivens-type claim against individuals who were allegedly officers and agents of the United States, the District Court eventually ratified a prior order denying a motion to dismiss the Bivens-type claims, expressing the view that (1) the constitutional wrong complained of was that, in violation of a Fifth Amendment right to be free to decide for oneself whether to submit to drug therapy, the Army had knowingly denied the sergeant the ability to appreciate and enjoy his life; (2) the Chappell v Wallace bar to Bivens-type actions was limited to a case in which a member of the military brought a suit against a superior officer for wrongs which involved direct orders in the performance of military duty and the discipline and order necessary thereto--special factors not involved in the case at hand; and (3) a possible alternative statutory remedy, under the Veterans' Benefit Act (38 USCS 301 et seq.), was insufficient (574 F Supp 474). Subsequently, the District Court certified its order for interlocutory appeal pursuant to 28 USCS 1292(b). On appeal, the United States Court of Appeals for the Eleventh Circuit--successor to the Fifth Circuit for appeals in the case at hand--affirmed in part and reversed in part, and the Court of Appeals (1) agreed with the District Court's conclusion that Chappell v Wallace did not require the dismissal of the sergeant's Bivens-type claims; but (2) directed the District Court, on remand, to allow the sergeant an opportunity to replead his FTCA claim against the United States, where (a) recent case law indicated that he had a viable FTCA claim, and (b) under the circumstances, such repleading was not barred by the prior Fifth Circuit ruling (786 F2d 1490).",lexis
"A complaint filed in the United States District Court for the District of Massachusetts alleged that, in exchange for the plaintiff's promise to care for and support her mother, the plaintiff's father orally agreed not to make a will, but that the father devised his property to his second wife, the defendant, from whom the plaintiff sought what would have been her intestate share of her father's estate. The District Court entered judgment dismissing the complaint on the ground that the oral agreement was unenforceable under the Massachusetts statute of frauds, and later entered judgment denying the plaintiff's motions to vacate the first judgment and to amend the complaint to assert a right of recovery in quantum meruit for the same services. The plaintiff filed a notice of appeal from each judgment. On appeal, the parties briefed and argued the merits of both judgments but the United States Court of Appeals for the First Circuit (1) dismissed the appeal from the first judgment on the grounds that the first notice of appeal was premature and that the second notice of appeal did not specify that the appeal was being taken from the first judgment as well as the second judgment, and (2) affirmed the second judgment on the ground that there was nothing in the record to show abuse of discretion in the lower court's refusal to allow the amendment of the complaint.

"In Batson v Kentucky (1986) 476 US 79, 90 L Ed 2d 69, 106 S Ct 1712, which involved a black defendant in a state criminal case, the United States Supreme Court held that the equal protection clause of the Federal Constitution's Fourteenth Amendment would be violated by a prosecutor's purposefully discriminatory exercise of peremptory challenges to remove from a jury venire members of the defendant's own race. Subsequently, in Powers v Ohio (1991) 499 US 400, 113 L Ed 2d 411, 111 S Ct 1364, which involved a white defendant in a state criminal case, the Supreme Court--in holding that a defendant may object to a prosecutor's allegedly race-based peremptory challenges regardless of whether the defendant and the excluded jurors share the same race--determined that such a defendant has third-party standing to raise the equal protection claims of the excluded jurors. A black construction worker who had been injured in a job-site accident at a federal enclave brought a negligence suit against a concrete company in the United States District Court for the Western District of Louisiana. When the company used two of its three peremptory challenges to remove black prospective jurors, the District Court rejected the worker's objections based on Batson v Kentucky and expressed the view that Batson v Kentucky did not apply in civil proceedings. Eventually, a jury of 11 whites and one black returned a verdict for the worker and assessed his total damages at $ 90,000, but attributed 80 percent of the fault to the worker's own contributory negligence, so that the net award was only $ 18,000. On appeal by the worker, a panel of the United States Court of Appeals for the Fifth Circuit, reversing and ordering a remand, expressed the view that peremptory challenges could not be used in a civil trial for the purpose of excluding jurors based on race (860 F2d 1308). On rehearing en banc, however, the Court of Appeals affirmed the District Court's judgment and expressed the view that a private litigant in a civil case can exercise peremptory challenges without accountability for alleged racial classifications, because the use of peremptory challenges by private litigants (1) does not constitute state action; and (2) thus, does not implicate federal constitutional guarantees (895 F2d 218).",lexis

Iowa defended the law as a reasonable safety measure pursuant to its police power, but the District Court found that the evidence established that 65-foot double-trailer trucks were as safe as the shorter single-trailer units and concluded that the state impermissibly burdened interstate commerce (475 F Supp 544).

"Law enforcement officers arrested the defendant, a bank robbery suspect, in the yard in front of the house in which he lived. Without asking the defendant which room he occupied or whether he would consent to a search, some officers went to the door of the house and were admitted by a woman. The officers told her that they were looking for money and a gun, and they asked if they could search the house. She consented to a search of the house, including the upstairs bedroom in which the defendant lived. The woman's parents were the lessees of the house, and the defendant paid them rent for his room. The officers found $ 4,995 in cash in the defendant's room, and the defendant was subsequently indicted, in a Federal District Court, for bank robbery. Alleging that the search of his room was invalid, the defendant sought to suppress evidence consisting of the cash found in his room. At the suppression hearing, the government presented testimony that the woman who consented to the search told the officers that she and the defendant occupied the same bedroom, shared the use of a dresser in the room, and had been sleeping together in the room regularly, including the early morning of the day of the search, and the government also presented testimony that the woman and the defendant, at various times and places and to various persons, had made statements that they were wife and husband. The District Court held that the testimony as to these out-of-court statements was inadmissible to prove the truth therein averred, and that the government did not meet its burden of proving that the woman's relationship to the defendant's bedroom was sufficient to make her consent to the search valid against the defendant. Accordingly, the District Court granted an order suppressing the evidence consisting of the cash found in the defendant's room.

On appeal, the Supreme Court of Texas reversed, reaffirming one of its prior decisions in which it had been ruled that a ""preponderance of the evidence"" standard of proof in a civil commitment proceeding satisfied due process, and holding that the trial court's use of a stricter standard was harmless error (557 SW2d 511).",lexis

"Under a statute of the Commonwealth of Puerto Rico, as administered by the Tourism Company of Puerto Rico (a public corporation), certain forms of casino gambling are legal, but no casino is authorized to advertise itself to the public of the Commonwealth. A hotel with a casino had been fined several times for violating the advertising regulations, and did not appeal the fines, but eventually filed suit against the tourism company in the Superior Court of Puerto Rico, San Juan Section, seeking a declaration that the casino advertising statute and regulations, both facially and as applied by the tourism company, impermissibly suppressed commercial speech in violation of the freedom of speech, equal protection, and due process guaranties of the United States Constitution. Determining that the Puerto Rican legislature had intended to prohibit only those advertisements contracted with an advertising agency, for consideration, to attract Commonwealth residents to gambling tables, the Superior Court issued the narrowing construction that (1) advertising addressed to tourists, provided a casino did not invite the residents of the Commonwealth to visit, was permitted within the jurisdiction of the Commonwealth, even though the advertising might incidentally reach the hands of a resident; (2) advertisements in media published, taped, or filmed exterior to the Commonwealth were permitted even though they might be exposed or incidentally circulated in the Commonwealth; (3) advertising in the mass circulation media of the country where the name of a hotel was used was permitted, even though the name might contain a reference to the casino, provided the word ""casino"" was never used alone nor specified; (4) the direct promotion of the casino within the premises of a hotel was allowed; and (5) in general, under any other situation, if the object of the advertisement was the tourist, it passed legal scrutiny.

S. C. §1703(f). In 2000, the Federal District Court entered a declaratory judgment, finding an EEOA violation in Nogales because the amount of funding the State allocated for the special needs of ELL students (ELL incremental funding) was arbitrary and not re- lated to the actual costs of ELL instruction in Nogales. The District Court subsequently extended relief statewide and, in the years fol- lowing, entered a series of additional orders and injunctions.

"The accused was convicted in a Louisiana trial court on two counts of manslaughter and three counts of first-degree murder. An essential element of the latter verdicts was the jury's finding that the accused had intended to kill or inflict great bodily harm on more than one person. Before the jury began its sentencing deliberations, the trial judge instructed them (1) that they should each consider the views of their fellows with the goal of reaching a verdict, but should not surrender their honest beliefs in doing so, and (2) that if they failed to reach a unanimous recommendation, the court would be required to sentence the accused to life imprisonment without possibility of parole, probation, or suspended sentence. When informed the next day that the jury was unable to reach a decision, the judge recalled the jury and asked each juror to write on a slip of paper (1) the juror's name and (2) whether the juror thought that further deliberations would be helpful in obtaining a verdict. Four jurors answered in the negative, and defense counsel unsuccessfully moved for a mistrial. On being advised that some jurors had misunderstood the question, the judge again polled the jury and found that only one juror believed that further deliberations would not enable the jury to arrive at a verdict. The judge then repeated the aforementioned instructions, and shortly thereafter the jury recommended a death sentence, which was based in part on the statutorily specified aggravating circumstance that the accused had knowingly created a great risk of death or great bodily harm to more than one person. Defense counsel had not objected to the polling or supplemental charge. The Supreme Court of Louisiana affirmed the accused's conviction and sentence; while holding that another aggravating circumstance relied on by the jury had been improperly applied, the court ruled that the aforementioned aggravating circumstance was sufficient to support the death sentence and that the jury had not been improperly coerced into recommending the sentence (495 So 2d 1245). The accused subsequently petitioned the United States District Court for the Eastern District of Louisiana for a writ of habeas corpus, on the theory, among others, that his death sentence was invalid because (1) the aggravating circumstance relied on was a necessary element of the underlying offense and (2) the judge had coerced a sentencing verdict from the jury.

Moreover, the text of _ 1334(b) preempted the rules that were based on smoking and health. The MUTPA said nothing about smoking or health. In sum, the phrase ""based on smoking and health"" fairly but narrowly construed did not encompass the more general duty not to make fraudulent statements. Thus, the MUTPA claim was not preempted.

The Court held that the Second Amendment protected the right to keep and bear arms for the purpose of self-defense and that the Second Amendment was fully applicable to the states. Self-defense was a basic right and was the central component of the Second Amendment right, and the Court had recognized that the Second Amendment right applied to handguns, which were the preferred firearm to keep and use for protection of one's home and family. A plurality of the Court found it unnecessary to disturb existing precedent that narrowly read the Fourteenth AmendmentPrivileges or Immunities Clause to protect only rights that owed their existence to the federal government. However, the framers and ratifiers of the Fourteenth Amendmentcounted the right to keep and bear arms as a fundamental right necessary to the nation's system of ordered liberty. The Fourteenth Amendment was not solely an antidiscrimination rule. The plurality therefore found that the Second Amendment right to keep and bear arms was incorporated and made applicable to the states by the Due Process Clause of the Fourteenth Amendment.",lexis
"The United States sued the state of Louisiana and four of its voting officials in the United States District Court for the Eastern District of Louisiana, alleging discrimination against Negro applicants for registration in 21 parishes by the application of an ""interpretation test"" under which applicants were required to interpret any section of the state or federal constitution when read to them by a voting registrar. After the suit was filed, the state board of registration adopted an allegedly objective ""citizenship test"" to be applied only to new voter applicants. A three- judge District Court (1) held the interpretation test invalid, (2) ordered that use of the citizenship test be postponed, in the 21 parishes where the interpretation test had been followed, until there was a complete reregistration of voters, so that the citizenship test could apply alike to all or to none, (3) retained jurisdiction of the case, and (4) ordered that monthly reports be filed concerning voting registration in the 21 parishes.

The District Court, in granting judgment and awarding damages to the class, concluded that (1) the donning and doffing of the protective gear were compensable under the FLSA, because they were integral and indispensable to the work of the employees; and (2) the walking time in question was also compensable, because such walking occurred during the workday ( 2001 U.S. Dist.

The District Court--in adopting a Magistrate Judge's opinion and granting partial summary judgment in favor of the employer--(1) rejected the employees' waiting claims, but (2) did not specifically address the issue of walking time between the plant's production line and the place of donning and doffing.

After initial questioning, the defendant made a request for counsel and the interrogation ceased. The next morning, police officers came to the jail and asked the see the defendant who thereupon informed the detention officer that he did not want to speak to anyone.

The trial court denied the motion, stating that the defendant's statement was voluntary, and he was subsequently convicted. On appeal, the Supreme Court of Arizona held that the defendant had invoked both his right to remain silent and his right to counsel during the first interrogation, but that he had waived both rights during the second meeting when he voluntarily gave his statements to the officers after again being informed that he need not answer questions and that he need not answer without the advice of counsel (122 Ariz 206, 594 P2d 72).",lexis

"Some black individuals and a civil rights organization filed separate class action complaints against an Alabama city and a county personnel board in the United States District Court for the Northern District of Alabama and alleged that the city and the board had engaged in racially discriminatory hiring and promotion practices, in violation of Title VII of the Civil Rights Act of 1964 (42 USCS 2000e et seq.) and other federal law. Prior to judgment, the parties entered into two consent decrees which included goals for the hiring and promotion of black firefighters. A firefighters' association filed objections to the proposed decrees as amicus curiae, but the District Court (1) denied as untimely motions to intervene by the association and two of its members, and (2) approved the consent decrees (28 BNA FEP Cas 1834). Seven white firefighters, all members of the association, then filed a complaint against the city and the board, seeking injunctive relief against enforcement of the decrees, but the District Court denied relief. On appeal, both the denial of intervention and the denial of injunctive relief were affirmed by the United States Court of Appeals for the Eleventh Circuit (720 F2d 1511), which also denied rehearing en banc (724 F2d 978). A new group of white firefighters then brought suit against the city and the board in the District Court and claimed that (1) the city and the board were making promotion decisions on the basis of race, in reliance on the consent decrees; and (2) these decisions constituted impermissible racial discrimination, in violation of the Federal Constitution and federal statutes including Title VII. Several blacks were allowed to intervene in their individual capacities to defend the decrees. Eventually, the District Court granted a motion to dismiss the white firefighters' cases as an impermissible collateral attack on the consent decrees and expressed the view that (1) if in fact the city was required by one of the consent decrees to make the promotions, then there would be no illegal racial discrimination, and (2) the defendants had established that the promotions of black individuals were in fact required by the terms of one of the consent decrees. On appeal, the Court of Appeals, reversing and ordering a remand, expressed the view that, because the new group of white firefighters were neither parties nor privies to the consent decrees, their independent claims of unlawful discrimination were not precluded (833 F2d 1492).

"Title XVI of the Social Security Act (42 USCS 1381 et seq.) provides a program of Supplemental Security Income (SSI) benefits to qualified individuals who are aged, blind, or disabled. Under 42 USCS 1382c(a)(3)(A), an individual is considered to be disabled if the individual is unable to engage in any substantial gainful activity by reason of any medically determinable physical or mental impairment which can be expected to result in death or which has lasted, or can be expected to last, for a continuous period of not less than 12 months, or, in the case of a child under the age of 18, if the child suffers from any medically determinable physical or mental impairment of comparable severity. Also, 42 USCS 1382c(a)(3)(B) provides that an individual's impairments must be of such severity that the individual not only is unable to do the individual's previous work, but cannot, considering the individual's age, education, and work experience, engage in any other kind of substantial gainful work which exists in the national economy. Under the regulations ( 20 CFR 416.920-416.930) and rulings of the Secretary of Health and Human Services as to the method to determine whether a child is ""disabled,"" a child qualifies only if (1) the child is not doing any substantial gainful activity; (2) the child's impairment meets a duration requirement; and (3) the child's impairment matches or is medically equal to one of the physical or mental impairments in the Secretary's listings of such impairments (20 CFR Part 404, Subpart P, Appx 1). Unlike the situation applicable to an adult claimant who fails to qualify under the listings, there is no further child-disability inquiry corresponding to the fourth and fifth steps of the Secretary's SSI adult-disability test, as to whether an adult claimant can do the claimant's own past work or any other work that exists in the national economy, in view of the adult's age, education, and work experience. A child who had been denied SSI benefits brought a class action in the United States District Court for the Eastern District of Pennsylvania to challenge the SSI child-disability regulations, but the District Court granted summary judgment in the Secretary's favor as to the class claims, on the grounds that the regulations (1) were not facially invalid or incomplete, and (2) permitted the award of benefits in conformity with the intent of Congress (642 F Supp 220). On appeal, the United States Court of Appeals for the Third Circuit, vacating in part the District Court's summary judgment, ruled that the Secretary's regulatory scheme for SSI child-disability benefits was inconsistent with the statute, because the scheme (1) did not account for all impairments of comparable severity, and (2) denied child claimants the individualized functional assessment that the statutory standard required and that the Secretary provided to adults (855 F2d 67).",lexis

The plaintiff alone testified at the trial, stating that he was inducted into the Japanese Armed Forces pursuant to the compulsory conscription law of that country, that rumors of harsh punishment of draft evaders by the secret police and the ruthlessness of the government in power made him afraid to take any action to avoid service, and that he did not seek aid of American officials.

"A company that provided educational, recreational, and social programs to individuals in the area of Cincinnati, Ohio, published a magazine which consisted primarily of promotional material pertaining to such programs, but which also included some information about current events of general interest. Another company published a magazine which advertised real estate for sale in the Cincinnati area, and which also included some information about interest rates, market trends, and other real estate matters. In 1989, the companies were authorized by the city to place a total of 62 newsracks on public property in the city, from which the magazines were distributed without charge. Pursuant to a provision of Cincinnati's municipal code, permitting the distribution of ""newspapers"" on the sidewalks of city streets, about 1,500 to 2,000 such newsracks, most of them dispensing conventional newspapers, were present in the city. In 1990, however, the city revoked the companies' permits to use such newsracks, on the ground that the magazines were ""commercial handbills"" within the meaning of the municipal code, and that a provision of the code prohibited the distribution of such handbills on public property. The companies, seeking declaratory and injunctive relief, brought suit against the city in the United States District Court for the Southern District of Ohio. The District Court, ruling in favor of the companies insofar as their claims were based on the Federal Constitution's First Amendment, expressed the view that (1) the magazines were a form of commercial speech; (2) the city had a burden, under the First Amendment, of establishing a reasonable fit between the city's asserted ends and the means chosen to accomplish those ends; and (3) the safety and esthetic interests asserted by the city did not reasonably fit the city's actions.

"A complaint was filed in the Municipal Court of Sonoma County, California, alleging that a then 17 1/2 year old male had had unlawful sexual intercourse with a female under the age of 18, in violation of California's ""statutory rape"" statute, which defines unlawful sexual intercourse as ""an act of sexual intercourse accomplished with a female not the wife of the perpetrator, where the female is under the age of 18 years."" Prior to trial, the defendant sought to set aside the complaint on both state and federal constitutional grounds, asserting that the statute unlawfully discriminated on the basis of gender. The trial court and California Court of Appeal denied this request, and on appeal the Supreme Court of California upheld the statute, holding that the state had a compelling interest in preventing teenage pregnancies, and that because males alone can physiologically cause the result which the law properly seeks to avoid, the gender classification was justified as a means of identifying offender and victim (25 Cal 3d 608, 159 Cal Rptr 340, 601 P2d 572).",lexis
"After leaving a Minneapolis, Minnesota apartment building which was considered by police officers to be a place of cocaine traffic, or a ""crack house,"" the accused began walking toward a marked squad car in which two police officers were patrolling. Upon making eye contact with one of the officers, the accused abruptly halted, began walking in the opposite direction, and turned and entered an alley on the other side of the building. The officers pulled the squad car into the alley and ordered the accused to stop and submit to a patdown search. The search revealed no weapons, but the officer who conducted the search felt a small lump in the front pocket of the accused's nylon jacket. As the officer later testified, the officer examined the lump with his fingers, and ""it slid and it felt to be a lump of crack cocaine in cellophane."" The officer then reached into the pocket and retrieved a small plastic bag containing one fifth of one gram of crack cocaine. The accused was arrested and charged with possession of a controlled substance. Prior to trial in a Minnesota county court, the accused moved to suppress the cocaine. Denying the motion, the trial court ruled that (1) under Terry v Ohio (1968) 392 US 1, 20 L Ed 2d 889, 88 S Ct 1868, the officers were justified in (a) stopping the accused to investigate whether he might be engaged in criminal activity, and (b) frisking the accused to insure that he was not carrying a weapon; and (2) the officers' warrantless seizure of the cocaine, after the officer who searched the accused ""formed the opinion"" that the small lump was cocaine, was supported by ""plain feel"" and hence did not violate the Federal Constitution's Fourth Amendment. The accused was tried and found guilty. On appeal, the Minnesota Court of Appeals, reversing, (1) concluded that the seizure of the cocaine was unconstitutional under Terry v Ohio; and (2) declined to adopt a ""plain feel"" exception to the Fourth Amendment's warrant requirement (469 NW2d 462). On further appeal, the Supreme Court of Minnesota, affirming, expressed the view that (1) the ""plain view"" exception to the warrant requirement did not extend to the sense of touch; and (2) even if a ""plain feel"" exception was recognized, an examination of the record indicated that the officer who searched the accused did not immediately recognize the lump in the accused's pocket as cocaine, but rather that the officer determined that the lump was contraband only after squeezing, sliding, and otherwise manipulating the contents of the pocket, which the officer already knew contained no weapon (481 NW2d 840).",lexis

"The city of San Diego, California, enacted an ordinance imposing substantial prohibitions on the erection of outdoor advertising displays within the city, the ordinance permitting on-site commercial advertising, but forbidding other commercial advertising and noncommercial communications using fixed-structure signs everywhere unless permitted by one of several specified exceptions. Several companies that were engaged in the outdoor advertising business in the city at the time the ordinance was passed brought suit in California state court to enjoin enforcement of the ordinance. After extensive discovery, the parties stipulated, among other things, that if enforced as written the ordinance would eliminate the advertising business in the city and that outdoor advertising increases the sales of products and produces numerous direct and indirect benefits to the public, valuable commercial, political, and social information being communicated to the public through the use of outdoor advertising and many businesses and politicians and other persons relying upon outdoor advertising because other forms of advertising are insufficient, inappropriate, and prohibitively expensive. On cross-motions for summary judgment, the trial court held that the ordinance was an unconstitutional exercise of the city's police power and an abridgement of the companies' First Amendment rights. The California Court of Appeal affirmed on the first ground alone and did not reach the First Amendment argument. The Supreme Court of California reversed, holding that the two purposes of the ordinance--to eliminate hazards to pedestrians and motorists brought about by distracting sign displays, and to preserve and improve the appearance of the city--were within the city's legitimate interests and that the ordinance was a proper application of municipal authority over zoning and land use for the purpose of promoting the public safety and welfare, the court rejecting the companies' argument that the ordinance was facially invalid under the First Amendment.",lexis

"Petitioners held federal gas leases that required the payment of the minimum royalty prescribed by 30 U.S.C.S. ¬¨√ü 226(b)(1)(A).

Petitioners argued that the payment order was barred by the six-year statute of limitations in 28 U.S.C.S. ¬¨√ü 2415(a). The Court held that the lower courts properly concluded that ¬¨√ü 2415(a) did not govern MMS administrative payment orders concerning pre-September 1, 1996, production. After considering the plain meaning of the terms ""action"" and ""complaint,"" the Court held that ¬¨√ü 2415(a)'s statute of limitations applied only to court actions. The Court rejected petitioners' assertions that the term ""action"" in ¬¨√ü 2415(a) also referred to administrative proceedings and that an MMS payment order constituted a ""complaint"" under ¬¨√ü 2415(a).

"In No. 713 the wife of an American officer who, as a military dependent, accompanied him to Japan, was tried by a general court-martial in Japan for the murder of her husband committed in that country. The jurisdiction of the court-martial rested on Art 2(11) of the Uniform Code of Military Justice, providing that all persons accompanying the Armed Forces without the limits of the United States shall be subject to the Code if such jurisdiction is authorized under any treaty or agreement to which the United States is a party. In habeas corpus proceedings the wife challenged the validity of her conviction on the ground that the court-martial had no jurisdiction because Art 2(11) violated various constitutional provisions, particularly those which guaranteed the right to trial by jury to a civilian. The United States District Court for the Southern District of West Virginia discharged the writ (137 F Supp 806). While her appeal from that dismissal was pending before the United States Court of Appeals for the Fourth Circuit, the government itself sought certiorari. In an opinion by Clark, J., five members of the Supreme Court held that Art 2(11) of the Code was constitutional and that consequently the court-martial had jurisdiction. Kinsella v Krueger (1956) 351 US 470, 100 L ed 1342, 76 S Ct 886. Warren, Ch. J., and Black and Douglas, JJ., dissented. Frankfurter, J., reserved an expression of his views for a later date.  In No. 701, a companion case to Kinsella v Krueger, the wife of an Air Force sergeant was tried by a court-martial in England for the murder of her husband in that country and was convicted and sentenced to life imprisonment. She was brought to the United States and was confined in a federal jail. On appeal, the United States Court of Military Appeals set aside her conviction and she was transferred to a District of Columbia jail to await a rehearing by the court-martial in the District. While there she filed a petition for a writ of habeas corpus, alleging that she was not subject to court-martial jurisdiction because Art 2(11) of the Uniform Code of Military Justice was unconstitutional. The United States District Court for the District of Columbia ordered the writ to issue, and the government appealed directly to the Supreme Court.

"A nonprobationary federal employee in a regional office of the Office of Economic Opportunity was discharged by his supervisor after the supervisor had given the employee notice of written charges against him, including the charge that the employee, without any proof and in reckless disregard of the actual facts known to or reasonably discoverable by him, had publicly stated that the supervisor and his assistant had attempted to bribe a third party, and after the employee had chosen not to exercise his right under administrative regulations to reply orally or in writing to the charges, but had instead asserted that he had a right to a trial-type hearing before an impartial hearing officer before he could be removed from his employment, and that his statements were protected by the First Amendment. The employee's discharge was effected pursuant to the provisions of (1) the Lloyd-La Follette Act (5 USCS 7501), authorizing removal or suspension without pay of a nonprobationary government employee ""only for such cause as will promote the efficiency of the service,"" and requiring that the employee be given written notice of the charges against him and an opportunity to file a written answer, but not requiring a pretermination trial-type hearing, and (2) implementing administrative regulations affording a post-removal evidentiary hearing on administrative appeal by the employee, with full back pay benefits if the employee prevails. After filing an administrative appeal with the Civil Service Commission, the employee, on behalf of himself and other employees similarly situated, instituted the instant action for injunctive and declaratory relief in the United States District Court for the Northern District of Illinois, contending that the removal standards and procedures established by and under the Lloyd-La Follette Act unconstitutionally interfered with government employees' freedom of expression and denied them procedural due process under the Fifth Amendment. Holding that the Act and attendant administrative regulations violated due process requirements in failing to provide for a trial-type hearing before an impartial agency official prior to removal, and that the statute and regulations were unconstitutionally vague in failing to furnish sufficiently precise guidelines as to what kind of speech could be made the basis of a removal action, the three-judge District Court ordered that the plaintiff be reinstated with back pay, and that he be accorded a pretermination hearing in any future removal proceedings (349 F Supp 863).",lexis
"Under a provision of the Copyright Act of 1976 (17 USCS 201(b)), if a work is a ""work for hire,"" the employer or other person for whom the work is prepared is considered the author and owns the copyright, unless there is a written agreement to the contrary. For copyright purposes, a work is a work for hire, under 17 USCS 101, where the work is (1) prepared by an employee within the scope of his or her employment; or (2) specially ordered or commissioned for use as a contribution to a collective work, as a part of a motion picture or other audiovisual work, as a translation, as a supplementary work, as a compilation, as an instructional text, as a test, as answer material for a test, or as an atlas, if the parties expressly agree in a written instrument signed by them that the work shall be considered a work made for hire. A nonprofit unincorporated association which was dedicated to eliminating homelessness orally commissioned an artist to produce a statue to dramatize the plight of homelessness. After the sculpture was completed and a dispute arose over it, competing copyright registrations for the sculpture were filed (1) by the sculptor, and (2) by an association member, in the member's capacity as trustee of the association. The association and the member then filed an action in the United States District Court for the District of Columbia against the sculptor and another person and sought a return of the sculpture and a determination of copyright ownership. The District Court, eventually ordering declaratory and injunctive relief, expressed the view that the association was the exclusive owner of the copyright on the sculpture, on the ground that the sculptor had been an ""employee"" within the meaning of 101(1), because the association was the motivating force in the sculpture's production (652 F Supp 1453). On appeal, the United States Court of Appeals for the District of Columbia Circuit, reversing, expressed the view that (1) the association could not claim ownership on the basis of the work for hire doctrine, where (a) the work was not prepared by an employee under 101(1), because the sculptor was an independent contractor under agency law, and (b) 101(2) was not applicable, for sculpture is not one of the nine 101(2) categories, and no written agreement existed between the parties; but (2) a remand was necessary to determine whether the sculpture was a joint work by the sculptor and the association (270 App DC 26, 846 F2d 1485).",lexis
"One of the provisions of Title VII of the Civil Rights Act of 1964 (42 USCS 2000e et seq.) is 42 USCS 2000e-2(a)(1), which in pertinent part prohibits an employer from discriminating against an individual with respect to ""terms, conditions, or privileges of employment,"" on the basis of race, color, religion, sex, or national origin. In Meritor Savings Bank v Vinson (1986) 477 US 57, 91 L Ed 2d 49, 106 S Ct 2399, which involved a sexual harassment claim asserted under Title VII, the United States Supreme Court held that pursuant to 2000e-2(a)(1), a plaintiff may establish a violation of Title VII by proving that discrimination based on sex has created a hostile or abusive work environment. A female worker who had quit a company filed suit against the company in the United States District Court for the Middle District of Tennessee and claimed that the conduct of the company's male president had created an abusive work environment for the worker because of her gender. A magistrate found that the president had often (1) insulted the worker because of her gender, and (2) made her the target of unwanted sexual innuendos. The District Court, in adopting the magistrate's report and recommendation, found the case to be ""close,"" but decided that the president's conduct had not created a hostile work environment, as the court expressed the view that while some of the president's comments had offended the worker and would offend a reasonable woman, (1) the comments had not been so severe as to be expected to affect seriously the worker's psychological well-being; and (2) the worker had not been subjectively so offended that she had suffered injury.

But before the effective date, the agency issued a final rule rescinding the passive restraint requirement in the standard, the agency stating that the requirement was no longer reasonable or practical in view of the possibly minimal safety benefits and the costs of implementing the requirement. An insurance company and an association of independent insurers filed petitions for review of NHTSA's rescission of the passive restraint standard. The United States Court of Appeals for the District of Columbia Circuit held that the agency's rescission of the passive restraint requirement was arbitrary and capricious (680 F2d 206).",lexis
"The Federal Railroad Administration (FRA), based upon evidence indicating that alcohol and drug abuse by railroad employees posed a serious threat to public safety, promulgated regulations addressing that problem. Some railway employees' unions sought to enjoin, on various statutory and constitutional grounds, (1) Subpart C of the regulations ( 49 CFR 219.201 et seq.), which required railroads to assure that certain railroad employees directly involved in certain train accidents resulting in deaths, injuries, or property damages provide blood and urine samples for testing by the FRA for the presence of alcohol and drugs, and (2) Subpart D of the regulations ( 49 CFR 219.301 et seq.), which authorized, but did not require, railroads to require certain railroad employees to submit to (a) a breath or urine test when a supervisor had a ""reasonable suspicion"" that an employee's acts or omissions contributed to a reportable accident or incident, or when an employee violated certain specific rules, or (b) a breath test when a supervisor, based upon specific, personal observations of an employee, had a ""reasonable suspicion"" that the employee was under the influence of alcohol. The United States District Court for the Northern District of California, holding that the railroad employees had a valid interest in the integrity of their own bodies that deserved protection under the Federal Constitution's Fourth Amendment, but that the governmental interest in promoting safety for railroad employees and for the general public under the regulations outweighed the employees' interest, granted summary judgment in favor of the Secretary of Transportation, under whose statutory authority the regulations had been adopted. The United States Court of Appeals for the Ninth Circuit, reversing the District Court's judgment, held that (1) the tests authorized by Subpart D involved sufficient government action to implicate the Fourth Amendment, (2) the breath, blood, and urine tests contemplated by the regulations were Fourth Amendment searches, (3) the exigencies of testing for the presence of alcohol and drugs in blood, urine, or breath required prompt action that precluded obtaining a warrant before performing the testing procedures, (4) because the accommodation of the railroad employees' privacy interest with the significant safety concerns of the government did not require a probable cause requirement for the performance of the testing procedures, the legality of the searches contemplated by the regulations depended on their reasonableness under all the circumstances, (5) particularized suspicion was essential to a finding that toxicological testing of railroad employees was reasonable, and (6) because the regulations, with certain exceptions, did not require a showing of individualized suspicion, the regulations were invalid (839 F2d 575).",lexis

In four cases that were consolidated in the United States District Court for the Southern District of Texas, families whose members generally bought their food and prepared their meals separately filed suit to invalidate the 1981 and 1982 amendments under the guaranty of equal treatment in the Fifth Amendment's due process clause and to be treated as separate households for the purpose of the Food Stamp Program.

"An independent government agency charged by the Massachusetts Legislature with providing water-supply services, sewage collection, and treatment and disposal services for eastern Massachusetts was ordered by the United States District Court for the District of Massachusetts to build sewage treatment facilities for the cleaning of Boston Harbor. Under the agency's enabling statute and Massachusetts' public bidding laws, the agency was to (1) provide funds for construction, (2) own the facilities to be built, (3) establish all bid conditions, (4) decide all contract awards, (5) pay the contractors, and (6) generally supervise the project. An engineering firm, hired as the agency's project manager, negotiated a labor agreement which, among other items, (1) recognized a particular union as the exclusive bargaining agent for all craft employees, and (2) established a 10-year no-strike commitment. The agency approved the agreement and adopted a bid specification, which required each contractor and subcontractor to agree to abide by the agreement and to be bound by the agreement's provisions. In response to a charge by a contractors' association that the agreement violated the National Labor Relations Act (NLRA) (29 USCS 151 et seq.), the general counsel of the National Labor Relations Board found that (1) the agreement was a valid prehire agreement under 8(f) of the NLRA (29 USCS 158(f)), and (2) the agreement's provisions limiting work on the project to contractors who agreed to abide by the agreement were lawful under a construction-industry proviso to 8(e) of the NLRA (29 USCS 158(e)). An organization representing nonunion construction industry employers--seeking, among other items, to enjoin enforcement of the bid specification as pre-empted under the NLRA--brought suit in the District Court against the agency, the engineering firm, and the union. The District Court denied the organization's motion for a preliminary injunction. On appeal, the United States Court of Appeals for the First Circuit reversed, expressing the view that the bid specification was pre-empted under the NLRA (135 BNA LRRM 2713, 117 CCH LC 10392, 1990-2 CCH Trade Cases 69229). The Court of Appeals subsequently vacated this opinion, but on rehearing en banc, the Court of Appeals again reversed the District Court, expressing the view that (1) the agency's intrusion into the bargaining process was pervasive and was not a permissible sort of peripheral regulation; and (2) the bid specification was pre-empted, because the agency was regulating activities that Congress intended to be unrestricted by governmental power (935 F2d 345).",lexis

"The petitioners, a group of college students, organized what they called a ""local chapter"" of Students for a Democratic Society (SDS), and filed a request for official recognition as a campus organization. Following a hearing at which representatives of the group stated that they would not affiliate with the national SDS and that the group would remain ""completely independent,"" the Student Affairs Committee of the college approved the application and recommended to the college president that the organization be accorded official recognition, the effect of which would have permitted the group to place announcements regarding meetings, rallies, or other activities in the student newspaper, to use various college bulletin boards, and to use campus facilities for holding meetings. However, the college president rejected the application, saying that the organization's philosophy was antithetical to the school's policies, and that the group's independence from the national SDS was doubtful. Thereafter, the petitioners filed suit in the United States District Court for the District of Connecticut, seeking declaratory and injunctive relief against the college's president, other administrators, and trustees, on the ground that their First Amendment rights of expression and association had been denied. Concluding that the college president had impermissibly based his decision on conclusions drawn from materials outside the record, the District Court ordered the college administration to hold another hearing to clarify several ambiguities surrounding the president's decision. The hearing was held, during which the petitioners, though reaffirming that they would have no connection whatsoever with the national SDS, equivocated when asked whether they might respond to ""issues of violence"" in the same manner as other SDS chapters had responded, and whether they could envision situations where they might advocate interrupting classes. Upon reviewing the hearing transcript and exhibits, the president reaffirmed his prior decision to reject the application, stating that the group would be a disruptive influence at the college and that recognition would be contrary to the orderly process of change on the campus. The case was subsequently returned to the District Court, where it was ordered dismissed (319 F Supp 113). The United States Court of Appeals for the Second Circuit affirmed on the theory that the petitioners had failed to avail themselves of the due process accorded them by the hearings and the court proceedings, and had failed to meet their burden of complying with the prevailing standards at the college for recognition of ""campus organizations"" (445 F2d 1122).",lexis

Some months thereafter the plaintiff, having moved to Florida, instituted the present diversity of citizenship action in the United States District Court for the Southern District of Florida to recover losses sustained in Florida and caused by deliberate acts of plaintiff's wife. The litigation presented three issues: (1) whether the ""all risks"" coverage of the policy included losses resulting from wilful injury to or appropriation of the injured property by the insured's spouse; (2) whether, as a matter of Florida law, a Florida statute invalidating contract provisions fixing the period of time for bringing suit under the contract was applicable to the insurance contract involved, the suit not having been brought within 12 months of the discovery of the loss, as required by the insurance policy; and (3) whether, as a matter of federal constitutional law, the Florida statute mentioned above could be applied to the insurance policy purchased in a sister state under the circumstances described above. The District Court entered judgment upon a verdict for the plaintiff and denied a motion for judgment non obstante veredicto.

Both before and during the trial, which began 2 weeks before an election in which the trial judge and the chief prosecutor were candidates for judgeships, the petitioner was the subject of extensive newspaper, radio, and television publicity. The publicity included many matters unfavorable to the defendant which were never presented in court. The trial judge denied various requests by defense counsel for a continuance, change of venue, mistrial, and interrogation of the jurors as to their exposure to the publicity. During the trial, which lasted 9 weeks, reporters were seated at a press table inside the bar, a few feet from the jury box; the corridors, the rooms throughout the courthouse, and most of the seats in the courtroom were filled with representatives of the news media; newsmen handled and photographed trial exhibits lying on the counsel table; radio broadcasting was done from a room next to the room where the jury recessed and deliberated; courtroom proceedings which were supposed to be private were overheard and reported by the press; and the noise of newsmen moving in and out of the courtroom made it difficult for counsel and witnesses to be heard. Before trial, the names and addresses of the jurors were published, and they received letters and phone calls concerning the case.

After she was asked what clothes her husband had worn on the night of the murder, she produced some of his clothing and gave it to the police.

A teacher, several students, and parents of students filed suit in the United States District Court for the District of New Jersey under 42 USCS 1983 against the state's department of education, its commissioner, and two township boards of education, alleging that the statute violated the establishment of religion clause of the Federal Constitution's First Amendment and seeking declaratory and injunctive relief. The attorney general of New Jersey had previously announced that he would not defend the statute if it were challenged. When it became apparent that neither he nor the named defendants would defend the statute, the Speaker of the New Jersey General Assembly and the President of the New Jersey Senate sought and obtained permission to intervene as defendants on behalf of the legislature in their capacities as presiding legislative officers, but not as individual legislators. The legislature, through these two legislators, carried the entire burden of defending the statute. The District Court held that the statute violated the establishment clause (572 F Supp 1561). The two legislators appealed in their official capacities as Speaker of the General Assembly and President of the Senate, although the named defendants again declined to participate in the case. In December 1985, the Court of Appeals affirmed the District Court's judgment (780 F2d 240). In January 1986, the two legislators lost their posts as presiding legislative officers. In March 1986, a notice of appeal was filed in the United States Supreme Court on behalf of the two legislators ""as Speaker of the New Jersey General Assembly"" and ""as President of the New Jersey Senate"" respectively. However, in May 1986, appellants' counsel informed the Supreme Court that the two legislators' successors as General Assembly Speaker and Senate President were withdrawing the legislature's appeal. The parties challenging the statute moved to dismiss the appeal.",lexis
"Following a jury trial in a Texas state court, the defendant was convicted of murder and sentenced to 50 years in prison. At the trial, the defendant contended that another person, who had already been convicted and sentenced for the same murder, had been the one who shot the victim, and that the defendant had attempted to prevent the shooting. The defendant claimed that the other person would testify to these facts, and he offered the other person's testimony, but the prosecution successfully objected to the other person's being permitted to testify, on the basis of statutory provisions that persons charged as principals, accomplices, or accessories in the same crime could not testify in behalf of one another. Rejecting the defendant's contention that the refusal to permit the other person to testify deprived the defendant of his constitutional right to have compulsory process for obtaining witnesses in his favor, the Texas Court of Criminal Appeals affirmed the conviction.

"The provisions for judicial review of federal administrative actions, under the Administrative Procedure Act (APA) (5 USCS 701-706), do not apply (1) under 5 USCS 701(a)(1), to the extent that statutes preclude judicial review, and (2) under 5 USCS 701(a)(2), to the extent that such actions are committed to agency discretion by law. At the same time, pursuant to 102(c) of the National Security Act of 1947 (NSA) (50 USCS 403(c)), the Director of Central Intelligence has the discretion to discharge any employee of the Central Intelligence Agency (CIA) whenever the Director ""shall deem such termination necessary or advisable in the interests of the United States."" A CIA employee who informed the CIA that he was a homosexual was eventually discharged by the then-incumbent Director pursuant to 102(c), possibly because the employee's homosexuality was supposed to constitute a security threat. The former employee then filed an action against the Director in the United States District Court for the District of Columbia, sought declaratory and injunctive relief, and claimed that his discharge (1) violated the APA's scope-of-review provision (5 USCS 706), as being arbitrary and capricious, an abuse of discretion, and contrary to the procedures required by law and by CIA regulations; and (2) transgressed alleged Federal Constitutional rights of the employee to (a) property, liberty, and privacy under the First, Fourth, Fifth, and Ninth Amendments, and (b) procedural due process and equal protection under the Fifth Amendment. The District Court, after denying a motion to dismiss the suit on the ground that 102(c) precluded judicial review of the discharge under the APA, (1) found that the employee had been unlawfully discharged because the CIA had not followed the procedures described in its own regulations; (2) ordered that the employee be reinstated to administrative leave status; and (3) instructed the CIA to reconsider the discharge decision, using procedures that would (a) supply the employee with the reasons supporting any discharge decision, and (b) provide the employee with an opportunity to respond. On appeal, the United States Court of Appeals for the District of Columbia Circuit vacated the District Court's judgment, and expressed the view that (1) neither 701(a)(1) nor 701(a)(2) precluded judicial review under the APA of the discharge decision; but (2) the CIA's employee-discharge regulations provided no independent source of procedural or substantive protection; and (3) as to the remaining claims, a remand was necessary for a determination of the Director's reason for the discharge--a point which the Court of Appeals found to be unclear from the record (796 F2d 1508).",lexis
"At his jury trial in a Montana state court on a charge of deliberate homicide, in that he ""purposely or knowingly"" caused the death of the victim, a defendant admitted killing the victim but argued that he did not do so purposely or knowingly and was therefore not guilty of deliberate homicide but of a lesser crime. The trial judge, upon the prosecution's request, instructed the jury that ""[t]he law presumes that a person intends the ordinary consequences of his voluntary acts,"" over the defendant's objection that the instruction had the effect of shifting the burden of proof on the issue of purpose or knowledge to the defense, and that such was impermissible in terms of due process of law under the Federal Constitution. After being found guilty of deliberate homicide, the defendant was sentenced to 100 years' imprisonment. On appeal, the Supreme Court of Montana affirmed the conviction, holding that although it is prohibited to shift the burden of proof to the defendant by means of a presumption, it is not prohibited to allocate some burden of proof to a defendant under certain circumstances, and that the instruction at issue did not violate due process standards as the defendant's sole burden was to produce some evidence that he did not intend the ordinary consequences of his voluntary acts, not to disprove that he acted purposely or knowingly (____ Mont ____, 580 P2d 106).",lexis
"In 1979, at the age of 61, an individual returned to the employ of a corporation for which the individual had previously worked. The corporation's retirement plan, which was a defined benefit plan under the Employee Retirement Income Security Act of 1974 (ERISA) (29 USCS 1001 et seq.), excluded employees who were over the age of 60 when hired from participation in the plan, as was then permissible under ERISA. However, 9201 and 9202(a) of the Omnibus Budget Reconciliation Act of 1986 (OBRA) (adding 29 USCS 623(i)(1) and 1054(b)(1)(H)(i)) amended the Age Discrimination in Employment Act of 1967 (ADEA) (29 USCS 621 et seq.) and ERISA, respectively, the effect of 9201 and 9202(a) being to prohibit age-based cessations of benefit accruals and age-based reductions in benefit accrual rates under employee benefit plans. It was further provided in 9204(a)(1) of OBRA (29 USCS 623 note) that 9201 and 9202 applied only with respect to plan years beginning on or after January 1, 1988, and only to employees who had 1 hour of service in any such plan year. On December 25, 1988, the first day of the plan year for the corporation's retirement plan, the individual and others who had previously been ineligible to participate in the plan due to their age became members of the plan. However, the corporation made it clear that it would not credit employees for years of service rendered before they became members of the plan. In 1990, the corporation amended its retirement plan to provide financial incentives for certain employees to retire early, under two programs which both required that participants release any employment-related claims which they might have against the corporation. The individual was eligible for one of the programs, but declined to participate because he did not wish to waive any ADEA or ERISA claims. After retiring without earning any extra benefits for doing so, the individual brought an action in the United States District Court for the Central District of California against the corporation and several of its directors and officers. The individual included allegations that (1) the corporation and the directors violated 406(a)(1)(D) of ERISA (29 USCS 1106(a)(1)(D)), which prohibits a fiduciary from causing a plan to engage in a transaction that transfers plan assets to a party in interest or involves the use of plan assets for the benefit of a party in interest; (2) the members of the corporation's retirement committee, who implemented the plan as amended in 1990 by the board of directors, also violated 406(a)(1)(D); and (3) the OBRA amendments to the ADEA and ERISA required the corporation to count the individual's pre-1988 service years toward his accrued pension benefits. The corporation moved to dismiss the complaint for failure to state a claim upon which relief could be granted, and the District Court granted the motion (1992 US Dist LEXIS 14583). On appeal, the United States Court of Appeals for the Ninth Circuit, reversing in relevant part, expressed the view that (1) the 1990 plan amendments violated 406(a)(1)(D) in that such amendments offered increased benefits in exchange for a release of employment claims and thus constituted a use of plan assets to purchase a significant benefit for the corporation; and (2) the corporation had violated the OBRA amendments to the ADEA and ERISA, which the Court of Appeals found to be applicable retroactively, by refusing to include the individual's service years prior to 1988 in determining his benefits (60 F3d 616).",lexis
"An individual who allegedly had manufactured methamphetamine at a facility in Oklahoma, until the facility was raided and shut down by federal agents, was subsequently arrested in Missouri, where he had taken delivery of chemicals and equipment used in methamphetamine production. The individual was charged and tried in the United States District Court for the Western District of Missouri on charges of attempt to manufacture methamphetamine. In the course of the trial the prosecution, in order to establish criminal intent, introduced evidence of the individual's previous drug manufacturing activities in Oklahoma, and the District Court instructed the jury that this evidence was admissible only to show the individual's state of mind with respect to the materials he had attempted to purchase in Missouri. The individual was convicted, and his conviction and sentence were affirmed by the United States Court of Appeals for the Eighth Circuit. The individual was subsequently indicted in the United States District Court for the Eastern District of Oklahoma on charges including (1) conspiracy to manufacture, possess, and distribute methamphetamine, which charge was supported by various overt acts including two based on conduct that had been the subject of the Missouri prosecution; (2) manufacture and possession of methamphetamine and related chemicals in Oklahoma; and (3) maintaining a methamphetamine manufacturing lab in Oklahoma. The individual was convicted, but the United States Court of Appeals for the Tenth Circuit reversed as to the above charges on the ground that they were barred by the double jeopardy clause of the Federal Constitution's Fifth Amendment, as the court (1) cited Grady v Corbin (1990) 495 US 508, 109 L Ed 2d 548, 110 S Ct 2084, to the effect that double jeopardy bars a subsequent prosecution where the government, to establish an essential element of an offense charged in that prosecution, will prove conduct that constitutes an offense for which the defendant has already been prosecuted; (2) observed, with regard to the Oklahoma conspiracy charge, that the prosecution in both trials had proved that the individual had learned to make and had manufactured methamphetamine in Oklahoma and had sought to purchase more materials in Missouri; and (3) noted, with regard to the substantive Oklahoma charges, that the direct evidence supporting those charges--namely, the individual's purchase of materials and manufacture of methamphetamine in Oklahoma--had been introduced in the Missouri trial to show intent (926 F2d 1522).",lexis

However, many--but not all--of the Federal Courts of Appeals had adopted an ""exculpatory no"" doctrine, which, with some variations, provided that simple denials of guilt did not come within 1001. In the case at hand, an individual who was a labor union officer accepted cash payments from a company whose employees were represented by the union. When federal investigatory agents, who were visiting the individual at his home, asked whether he had received any cash or gifts from the company when he was a union officer, he replied ""no."" The individual was (1) indicted for (a) accepting unlawful cash payments from an employer, in violation of federal labor law, and (b) making a false statement within the jurisdiction of a federal agency, in violation of 1001; (2) tried, along with several codefendants, before a jury in the United States District Court for the Southern District of New York; and (3) found guilty. On appeal, the United States Court of Appeals for the Second Circuit, in affirming in pertinent part, rejected the exculpatory no doctrine as a defense to a false-statement charge under 1001 (96 F3d 35, 1996 US App LEXIS 24261).",lexis

The Court rejected respondents' contention that the scope of the Act was indefinite. The Act clearly proscribed performing only the intact dilation and evacuation procedure. Further, the Act's scienter requirement narrowed the scope of the Act's prohibition and limited prosecutorial discretion. The restrictions on second-trimester abortions were not too broad because the Act provided specific anatomical landmarks and included an overt-act requirement. The Court also held that the Act's failure to allow the banned procedure's use where necessary for the mother's health did not have the effect of imposing an unconstitutional burden of the abortion right because safe medical options were available. The Court found that the proper means to consider exceptions was by as-applied rather than facial challenges.",lexis
"After a coal company had hired the plaintiff as mine superintendent to attempt to open a new mine and had given him a contract to haul the mine's coal to a railroad loading point, armed members of one of the local unions of the defendant international union forcibly prevented the opening of the mine, threatened the plaintiff, and beat an organizer for a rival union whose members were to be used for work at the mine. The defendant had no representatives present at the time of such violence, but the defendant's field representative for the area including the local union learned of the violence while attending an out-of-town meeting, and he returned with explicit instructions from his international union superiors to establish a limited picket line, to prevent any further violence, and to see to it that the strike did not spread to neighboring mines. There was no further violence at the mine site, a picket line was maintained there for 9 months, and no further attempts were made to open the mine during that period. The plaintiff lost his job as superintendent, never entered into performance of the haulage contract, and allegedly began losing other trucking contracts and mine leases he held in nearby areas. Subsequently, he sued the defendant in the United States District Court for the Eastern District of Tennessee, seeking damages under 303 of the Labor Management Relations Act on the basis of an alleged secondary boycott, and also seeking damages under state law on the basis of an unlawful boycott and an unlawful conspiracy to interfere with his contract of employment and his contract of haulage. The trial judge, who found that the plaintiff's claims of pressure intended to cause mining firms other than his employer to cease doing business with him were unsupported by the evidence, refused to submit such claims to the jury, but in connection with both the employment contract and the plaintiff's haulage contract with his employer, the jury found that the defendant had violated both 303 and state law, and it awarded punitive damages, as well as awarding compensatory damages. The trial court set aside the award under the haulage contract on the ground that damage was unproved, held that union pressure causing the plaintiff's discharge as superintendent did not violate 303, and granted a remittitur as to both the punitive damages and the compensatory damages under the state law claim for interference with the employment contract.

During the questioning, the officers repeatedly told the accused that he was free to leave, but also told him that they knew he had killed the victim. The accused was not informed of his rights under Miranda v Arizona (1966) 384 US 436, 16 L Ed 2d 694, 86 S Ct 1602, 10 ALR3d 974. Eventually, he told the officers that he had killed his former wife. Following the interview, the accused was allowed to leave the police headquarters; he was arrested 2 hours later and charged with first-degree murder. The accused filed a motion to suppress his statements to the police, which the Alaska trial court denied, finding that the accused was not ""in custody"" for Miranda purposes when the police questioned him and, therefore, that the police had not been obligated to inform him of his Miranda rights. The accused was subsequently convicted of first-degree murder and sentenced to imprisonment of 99 years. The conviction was upheld by the Court of Appeals of Alaska (768 P2d 127), and the Alaska Supreme Court denied discretionary review. The accused then filed a petition for a writ of habeas corpus in the United States District Court for the District of Alaska, which denied the writ, according--under 28 USCS 2254(d)'s presumption, in federal habeas corpus proceedings, of the correctness of state court determinations of issues of fact--a presumption of correctness to the state court's conclusion that when he confessed, the accused was not yet in custody for Miranda purposes.

"In connection with a protracted labor dispute, two mining companies filed suit in the Circuit Court of Russell County, Virginia, to enjoin a labor union from conducting unlawful strike-related activities. The Circuit Court entered an injunction which prohibited the union and its members from engaging in various activities, including obstructing ingress and egress to company facilities, physically threatening company employees, placing tire-damaging objects on roads used by company vehicles, and picketing with more than a specified number of people at designated sites. In the following month, the Circuit Court held a contempt hearing and found that the union had committed numerous violations of the injunction. The Circuit Court, stating that its purpose was to impose prospective civil fines, announced that it would fine the union $ 100,000 for any future violent breach of the injunction and $ 20,000 for any future nonviolent breach. In seven subsequent contempt hearings, each one conducted as a civil proceeding before a trial judge without a jury, the Circuit Court found the union in contempt for more than 400 separate violations, many of them violent, and levied fines of over $ 52 million payable to the state and two counties and approximately $ 12 million payable to the companies. Ultimately, the union and the companies settled the underlying labor dispute, agreed to vacate the contempt fines, and jointly moved to dismiss the case. The Circuit Court (1) granted the motion to dismiss, dissolved the injunction, and vacated the fines payable to the companies, but refused to vacate the remaining fines; and (2) appointed a special commissioner to collect those fines on behalf of the state and the counties. The Court of Appeals of Virginia, reversing, ordered that the fines be vacated pursuant to the settlement agreement. The Supreme Court of Virginia, in reversing on consolidated appeals, (1) rejected the union's contention that the outstanding fines were criminal and could not be imposed absent a criminal trial; and (2) reasoned that (a) the fines had been intended to coerce compliance with the injunction, (b) the union could have avoided the fines through obedience, and (c) the fines were thus civil and had properly been imposed in civil proceedings (244 Va 463, 423 SE2d 349).",lexis

The U.S. Supreme Court held that, while the search violated the Fourth Amendment under its new precedent, the exclusionary rule did not apply to require suppression of the firearm since the police conducted the search in objectively reasonable reliance on existing and binding judicial precedent. The sole purpose of the exclusionary rule was to deter deliberate or reckless disregard for Fourth Amendment rights, the police acted with an objectively reasonable and good-faith belief that their conduct was lawful, and the exclusionary rule did not require deterrence of such conduct.

"A public building authority issued bonds in 1986 and 1988 to finance public improvements at a planned development, with a bank serving as indenture trustee for the bond issues. The bonds were secured by landowner assessment liens, and the bond covenants required that (1) the land subject to the liens be worth at least 160 percent of the bonds' outstanding principal and interest, and (2) the developer give the bank annual reports containing evidence that the 160 percent requirement was met. After questions were raised about a January 1988 report indicating that the value of the land in question had remained steady since 1986, the bank's in-house appraiser reviewed the report, decided that the listed land values appeared to be optimistic, and suggested a review by an outside appraiser. The bank, however, decided to delay such a review until the end of the year, 6 months after the closing on the bond issue. Before the independent review was complete, the authority defaulted on the 1988 bonds. Purchasers of the 1988 bonds filed an action in the United States District Court for the District of Colorado and alleged that (1) the authority, two underwriters, and a director of the developer had violated 10(b) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 (15 USCS 78j(b)), and (2) the bank was secondarily liable under 10(b) for aiding and abetting the other defendants' fraud.

At his subsequent trial for criminal possession of a controlled substance, the occupant's motion to suppress the cocaine seized from the jacket pocket was denied, and he pleaded guilty to a lesser included offense, while preserving his claim that the cocaine had been seized in violation of the Fourth and Fourteenth Amendments. The Appellate Division of the New York Supreme Court upheld the constitutionality of the search and seizure, reasoning that once the occupant was validly arrested for possession of marijuana, the officer was justified in searching the immediate area for other contraband (68 App Div 2d 198). The Court of Appeals of New York reversed, holding that a warrantless search of the zippered pockets of an unaccessible jacket may not be upheld as a search incident to a lawful arrest where there is no longer any danger that the arrestee or a confederate might gain access to the article (50 NY2d 447, 407 NE2d 420).",lexis
"Respondent, an American soldier, while guarding a machine gun and clothing left in an Army exercise area in Japan, fatally wounded a Japanese woman who was gathering expended cartridge cases in the area. The Secretary of Defense and the Secretary of State determined that respondent should, as requested by Japanese authorities, be delivered for trial on criminal charges in the Japanese courts. These American authorities acted pursuant to an Administrative Agreement, authorized by the Security Treaty between Japan and the United States, which, although providing that the United States should have primary jurisdiction over members of the Armed Forces in relation to offenses arising out of any act or omission done in the performance of official duty, also provides that a state having primary jurisdiction in any particular case may decide not to exercise jurisdiction, and that the authorities of the state having the primary right shall give sympathetic consideration to a request from the authorities of the other state for a waiver of its right where such other state considers the waiver to be of particular importance. Seeking to avoid trial in the Japanese courts, respondent sought a writ of habeas corpus in the United States District Court for the District of Columbia. The writ was denied, but respondent was granted declaratory relief and an injunction against his delivery to the Japanese authorities (____ F Supp ____).",lexis
"A mobile home park owner, having once sued unsuccessfully in an Illinois trial court to evict a tenant, filed a second eviction proceeding claiming nonpayment of rent by the tenant. Prior to the hearing in the second proceeding, the park manager notified the county sheriff's department that she was going to remove the tenant's trailer home from the park, and requested the presence of deputy sheriffs to forestall any resistance. Up to five deputy sheriffs were present as park employees disconnected the home's sewer and water connections and towed it out of the park, which caused serious damage to the home. The deputies informed the tenant that they were there to prevent him from interfering, and, when he sought to file a complaint for criminal trespass, referred him to a deputy lieutenant who had remained in the manager's office. After talking to a prosecuting attorney, the lieutenant declined to accept the complaint on the ground that the matter was between the tenant and the park owner. Throughout this period, the deputies were aware that the owner did not have an eviction order and that the eviction was unlawful. A few days later, a state court ruled that the eviction had been unauthorized and ordered the park owner to return the tenant's trailer home to the park. The tenant subsequently filed an action under 42 USCS 1983 in a Federal District Court against the park owner and manager and the deputies, alleging that these defendants had violated the tenant's rights under the Federal Constitution's Fourth and Fourteenth Amendments by conspiring to unreasonably seize and remove the home. The District Court granted summary judgment in favor of the defendants, on the ground that the tenant had failed to adduce any evidence to support a conspiracy theory and thus to show the existence of state action required under 1983. The United States Court of Appeals for the Seventh Circuit, affirming in part and reversing in part, held that (1) there was state action, but (2) the removal of the home did not constitute a ""seizure"" for purposes of the Fourth Amendment (923 F2d 1241, reaffirmed en banc 942 F2d 1073).",lexis

A three-judge District Court denied relief, ruling (1) as to the 1955 oath and underlying statutory provisions, that there was no infringement upon any First and Fourteenth Amendment freedoms and that the statutes were not unduly vague, and (2) as to the 1931 oath, that adjudication was not proper in the absence of proceedings in the state courts which might resolve or avoid the constitutional issue.

"In an attempt to insure that musical performances at a bandshell in a city park were loud enough to be satisfactory to the audience without being so loud as to intrude upon those who lived on nearby streets or used a nearby park section designated by the city as a quiet area for passive recreation, the city promulgated a guideline requiring the sponsors of all musical performances at the bandshell to use sound-amplification equipment and a sound technician provided by the city. The city hired a private sound company, which was capable of meeting the needs of all the varied users of the bandshell, to provide the amplification equipment and technician for bandshell concerts. An unincorporated association that sponsored an annual program of speeches and rock music at the bandshell, had previously furnished the sound equipment and sound technician used by the various groups performing at its programs, and was, in its own words, ""dedicated to the espousal and promotion of antiracist views,"" was granted, by the United States District Court for the Southern District of New York, a preliminary injunction against the enforcement of the guideline (636 F Supp 178). Under the protection of this injunction, the association used its own sound equipment and technician for its concert. As had occurred in prior years, the concert generated complaints from park users and nearby residents about excessive noise. After the concert, the association sought damages and a declaratory judgment striking down the guideline as facially invalid. Finding that the performers who had used the city's sound system in other concerts were uniformly pleased with the quality of the sound provided, that the city's practice was to confer with the concert sponsor before deciding to turn the volume down, that the city's sound technician did all he could to accommodate each concert sponsor's desires regarding sound mix, and that the city provided a sound-amplification system capable of meeting the association's technical needs and left control of the sound mix in the association's hands, the District Court held that the guideline was a constitutional regulation of protected speech (658 F Supp 1376). Concluding that the sound-amplification guideline was invalid because the city had failed to prove that it was the least intrusive means of regulating sound volume, the United States Court of Appeals for the Second Circuit reversed the judgment of the District Court (848 F2d 367).",lexis
"Two children, the unmarried parents of whom were both enrolled members of an Indian tribe and were residents and domiliciaries of a tribal reservation in Mississippi, were born in Harrison County, Mississippi, some 200 miles from the reservation. Both parents executed consent-to-adoption forms, and a non-Indian couple successfully petitioned the Chancery Court of Harrison County, Mississippi, for a decree of adoption. The tribe subsequently made a motion in the Chancery Court to vacate the adoption decree on the ground that that court lacked jurisdiction over the adoption, because of a provision of the Indian Child Welfare Act (ICWA) (25 USCS 1911(a)) which states that tribal courts generally have jurisdiction exclusive as to any state over child custody proceedings involving Indian children domiciled on the reservation. The Chancery Court, however, overruled the tribe's motion, as it noted that the children had never resided or physically been on the reservation, and that the mother had gone to some effort to see that her children were born elsewhere and had arranged the adoption at issue. In affirming the Chancery Court's ruling, the Supreme Court of Mississippi held that (1) at no point in time could the children be said to have been domiciled on the reservation within the meaning of 1911(a); (2) state court decisions providing that the domicile of minor children follows that of the parents were distinguishable on their facts; and (3) even if the Chancery Court had erred in assuming jurisdiction, it had adhered to the minimum federal standards for such adoptions with regard to parental consent, notice, and the like (511 So 2d 918).",lexis

"With extensive federal assistance and supervision, the Mescalero Apache Tribe established a comprehensive scheme for managing the reservation's fish and wildlife resources. Federally approved tribal ordinances regulated in detail the conditions under which both members of the Tribe and nonmembers could hunt and fish. However, New Mexico sought to apply its own hunting and fishing laws to nonmembers on the reservation land owned by the Tribe, the state's laws conflicting with and at times being more restrictive than the tribal regulations. New Mexico enforced its regulations by arresting non-Indian hunters for illegal possession of game killed on the reservation in accordance with tribal ordinances, but not in accordance with state hunting regulations. The Tribe filed suit against the state, and the director of the state department responsible for enforcing its hunting and fishing laws, in the United States District Court for the District of New Mexico, seeking to prevent the state from regulating on-reservation hunting or fishing by tribal members or nonmembers. The District Court ruled in favor of the Tribe, and granted declaratory and injunctive relief against the enforcement of the state's hunting and fishing laws against any person for hunting and fishing activities conducted on the reservation. The United States Court of Appeals for the Tenth Circuit affirmed (630 F2d 724), and after having its judgment vacated and remanded by the United States Supreme Court (68 L Ed 2d 234), the Court of Appeals adhered to its earlier decision (677 F2d 55).",lexis

"The government of Allegheny County, Pennsylvania, permitted the Holy Name Society, a Roman Catholic organization, to display a creche--a representation of the nativity of Jesus--on the grand staircase inside the main part of the county courthouse in Pittsburgh during the Christmas season each year. During the 1986-1987 season, the creche was on display from November 26 to January 9. The creche display included an angel bearing a banner that proclaimed, ""Gloria in Excelsis Deo!"" (""Glory to God in the Highest!""). The display bore a plaque that said, ""This Display Donated by the Holy Name Society."" The creche stood alone as the single element of the display and was surrounded by a floral decoration. Although Santa Claus figures and other Christmas decorations were present elsewhere in the courthouse, there were no such decorations on the staircase. A nearby ""gallery forum"" area, used for art and other cultural exhibits, was not connected with the creche display. Decorations similar to those in the display were placed next to official county signs on each side of the staircase. The creche was the setting for a program of Christmas carols and other songs from December 3 to December 23, 1986, such program occupying at most 2 hours a day. The county issued press releases identifying the choral program as county sponsored and linking the program to the creche. Another display, outside an office building jointly owned by the city of Pittsburgh and Allegheny County, consisted of (1) a 45-foot Christmas tree, (2) an 18-foot menorah, a candelabrum associated with the Jewish holiday of Chanukah, and (3) a sign bearing a message that the city salutes liberty during the holiday season. The tree was erected on November 17, 1986; the sign was placed at its foot a few days later, and the menorah was erected next to the tree on December 22, 1986. All were removed on January 13, 1987. The menorah was owned by a Jewish religious organization, but it was stored, erected, and removed by the city. A civil liberties organization and several local residents filed suit in Federal District Court to enjoin the county from displaying the creche and the city from displaying the menorah on the ground that such displays violated the establishment of religion clause of the Federal Constitution's First Amendment. The District Court, holding that the creche and menorah displays did not violate the establishment of religion clause, denied injunctive relief. The United States Court of Appeals for the Third Circuit, reversing, held that both displays had the impermissible effect of endorsing religion (842 F2d 655).",lexis
"These cases presented the issue whether the religion clauses of the First Amendment were violated by state statutes providing state aid to church- related elementary and secondary schools, and to teachers therein, with regard to instruction in secular matters. In Nos. 569 and 570, citizens and taxpayers of Rhode Island brought suit against state officials in the United States District Court for the District of Rhode Island to enjoin, as repugnant to the religion clauses of the First Amendment and the due process clause of the Fourteenth Amendment, the operation of a Rhode Island statute providing for payment of up to 15-percent annual salary supplements to teachers of secular subjects in nonpublic elementary schools. Under the statute, the teacher was required to be employed in a nonpublic school at which the average per-pupil expenditure on secular education was less than the public school average; the school's financial records were subject to audit by the state; the teacher was required to teach only those subjects offered in the public schools, using teaching materials used in the public schools; and upon applying for a salary supplement, the teacher was required to first agree in writing not to teach a course in religion while receiving salary supplements. After hearing evidence which concerned the nature of secular instruction offered in Roman Catholic schools--only teachers at such schools having applied for benefits under the statute--the three-judge District Court found that the parochial school system was an integral part of the religious mission of the church, and held that the statute violated the establishment clause of the First Amendment. (316 F Supp 112.) In No. 89, a similar action against state officials was instituted in the United States District Court for the Eastern District of Pennsylvania by Pennsylvania residents and taxpayers, and associations thereof, challenging the constitutionality of a Pennsylvania statute providing for state reimbursement of nonpublic elementary and secondary schools for costs of teachers' salaries, textbooks, and instructional materials in specified secular subjects, but prohibiting reimbursement for any course that contained any subject matter expressing religious teaching or the morals or forms of worship of any sect. Under the Pennsylvania statute, the participating schools were required to maintain prescribed accounting procedures to identify the cost of secular educational service; such accounts were subject to state audit; reimbursement was limited to courses presented in the public schools' curricula; and textbooks and instructional materials were subject to approval by the state. The complaint alleged that church-related schools, which were the principal beneficiaries under the statute, were controlled by religious organizations, had the purpose of propagating a particular religious faith, and conducted their operations to fulfil such purpose. The three-judge District Court dismissed the complaint for failure to state a claim for relief, holding that the statute did not violate the First Amendment. (310 F Supp 35.)",lexis

Although the defendant's testimony at his trial would have entitled him to a lesser included offense instruction on felony murder which, under state law, was a lesser included offense of the capital crime of robbery-intentional killing for which he was tried, the court did not instruct the jury as to the lesser included offense. Instead, the court instructed the jury in accordance with the Alabama death penalty statute which prohibits the judge from giving the jury the option of convicting the defendant of the lesser included offense and requires that the jury either convict the defendant of the capital crime, in which case it must impose death penalty, or acquit him. Subsequently the jury convicted the defendant and imposed the death penalty, and the trial court refused to overturn that penalty. On appeal, the defendant attacked the prohibition on lesser included offense instructions in capital cases as being unconstitutional, but the Court of Criminal Appeals of Alabama rejected such argument on the grounds that the jury's only function under the state statute was to determine guilt or innocence and that the death sentence the jury was required to impose after a finding of guilt was merely advisory. The Supreme Court of Alabama also rejected the prisoner's arguments in denying review, citing a prior decision in which it had upheld the constitutionality of the death penalty statute against a similar challenge (365 So 2d 1006).",lexis
"Following her dismissal from employment by a school district, a teacher, seeking reinstatement, intervened in a desegregation action against the school district in the United States District Court for the Northern District of Mississippi. Among other things, the teacher contended that the dismissal infringed her right of free speech secured by the First and Fourteenth Amendments. As justification for its action, the school district introduced evidence of a series of private encounters between the teacher and the school principal during which the teacher allegedly made ""petty and unreasonable demands"" in a manner described by the principal as ""insulting,"" ""hostile,"" ""loud,"" and ""arrogant."" The District Court concluded that the main reason for the teacher's dismissal was her criticism of the school district's policies, which she believed to be racially discriminatory. Accordingly, the District Court held that the dismissal violated the teacher's First Amendment rights, and ordered her reinstatement. The United States Court of Appeals for the Fifth Circuit reversed, concluding that because the teacher had spoken privately with the principal, her expression was not protected by the First Amendment, and furthermore, that there was no constitutional right to ""press even 'good' ideas on an unwilling recipient"" (555 F2d 1309).",lexis

The District Court denied the petition on the ground that the body would inevitably have been found by searchers in essentially the same condition as it was in when the prisoner led the police to its discovery (528 F Supp 664).

Police officers investigating a double murder in Michigan brought a suspect to a police station for questioning. When the suspect denied any involvement in the murders, an officer told him that he could either give them the truth or they would charge him and lock him up. The suspect then admitted furnishing the murder weapon to the killer, who had called the suspect after the crime and told him where the weapon and other incriminating items had been discarded. The officers then advised the suspect of his Miranda rights for the first time; but he waived those rights and made further inculpatory statements. The suspect, charged with murder and unlawful possession of a firearm, moved before trial to suppress his responses to interrogation; but a Michigan trial court declined to suppress the above statements on the ground that the accused had been given a timely warning of his Miranda rights. After the accused was convicted and his conviction was upheld on direct appeal, the accused petitioned a Federal District Court for a writ of habeas corpus and alleged a violation of his Miranda rights as the principal ground for relief. The District Court, granting relief, not only (1) found that the accused had been placed in custody when the police threatened to lock him up, and that therefore all statements made between that point and the time that he was advised of his Miranda rights ought to have been excluded; but also (2) concluded--although neither the accused nor the prison warden who was opposing the petition had addressed the issue--that the accused's statements made after the Miranda warning had been involuntary and therefore suppressible under the due process clause of the Federal Constitution's Fourteenth Amendment.

One checkpoint was conducted under the program, which checkpoint was in operation for 75 minutes, during which time 126 vehicles passed through, each vehicle being delayed an average of about 25 seconds; two drivers were detained for field sobriety testing, one of these drivers was arrested for driving under the influence of alcohol, and a third driver who drove through without stopping was pulled over and arrested for driving under the influence of alcohol. On the day before the operation of the checkpoint, a group of licensed Michigan drivers filed a complaint in the Circuit Court of Wayne County, Michigan and sought declaratory and injunctive relief from potential subjection to the checkpoints. The Circuit Court (1) ruled that the checkpoint program violated both the Federal Constitution's Fourth Amendment and a provision of the state constitution, as the court found that (a)although the state had a legitimate interest in curbing drunk driving, sobriety checkpoints are not an effective means of achieving that goal, given the statistically low arrest rate, and (b) although the objective intrusion caused by the checkpoints, measured by the duration of the seizure and the intensity of the investigation, was minimal, the subjective intrusion on liberty interests, in terms of potential to generate fear and surprise to motorists, was substantial; and accordingly (2) entered an order permanently enjoining the implementation of the program. The Court of Appeals of Michigan affirmed, as it (1) found that the Circuit Court's findings were not clearly erroneous, (2) concluded that the checkpoint program violated the Fourth Amendment, and (3) ruled that since the state constitution offered at least the same protection as the Fourth Amendment, the checkpoints also violated the state constitution (170 Mich App 433, 429 NW2d 180).

In 1982, the lessee paid its state taxes under protest and then brought an action in a New Mexico state District Court, challenging the taxes under provisions including the Federal Constitution's commerce clause (Art I, 8, cl 3) and supremacy clause (Art VI, cl 2). At trial, the lessee presented evidence tending to prove that (1) the amount of tax the lessee paid to the state far exceeded the value of services that New Mexico provided to the lessee; and (2) the taxes paid by all non-Indian producers far exceeded the value of services provided to the reservation as a whole. In addition, the tribe, which was permitted to file a brief amicus curiae, argued that a decision upholding the state taxes would (1) substantially interfere with the tribe's ability to raise its own tax rates, and (2) diminish the desirability of on-reservation oil and gas leases. The District Court, however, issued a decision upholding the state taxes. On appeal, the Court of Appeals of New Mexico affirmed, and expressed the view that New Mexico's taxes (1) satisfied the test that, where tribal and state taxes on the same activity overlap, a state tax does not offend the commerce clause if the tax (a) is applied to an activity with a substantial nexus with the state, (b) is fairly apportioned, (c) does not discriminate against interstate commerce, and (d) is fairly related to the services provided by the state; and (2) withstood federal pre-emption analysis, as used in Indian law, because the record contained no evidence of any adverse impact on the tribe by the imposition of the taxes (106 NM 517, 745 P2d 1170). The New Mexico Supreme Court granted, but then quashed, a writ of certiorari (106 NM 511, 745 P2d 1159).",lexis
"At administrative proceedings to determine a social security disability claim arising from the claimant's work-related back injury, the hearing examiner admitted in evidence the written reports of some licensed physicians who had examined the claimant, which reports set forth findings within the physicians' areas of competence and which were generally unfavorable to the claimant. These physicians were not present and did not testify at the hearing. The examiner also admitted testimony of a physician, selected as the examiner's medical adviser, which testimony was based on the other medical evidence rather than on an examination of the claimant. The claimant's objections to the admission of such testimony and the medical reports, based on hearsay and denial of the right to cross-examine the physicians who had prepared the reports, were overruled by the examiner, who concluded that the claimant had not met his burden of proving entitlement to disability benefits, notwithstanding the testimony of the claimant and the physician who had treated him to the effect that the claimant was totally and permanently disabled. The examiner's conclusion was affirmed by the Appeals Council. On review, the United States District Court for the Western District of Texas remanded the case for a new hearing before a different examiner, concluding that admission of the reports denied the claimant the opportunity to cross-examine the witnesses (288 F Supp 313). On appeal, the Court of Appeals for the Fifth Circuit held that the claimant's failure to request subpoenas precluded his complaint about inability to cross-examine, and that the reports, although hearsay evidence, were admissible in administrative hearings. However, the Court of Appeals affirmed the District Court's judgment because of its conclusion that the reports did not constitute ""substantial evidence,"" as required by 205(g) of the Act (42 USC 405 (g)), that would support the hearing examiner's findings in view of the objections made to it and its contradiction by evidence from the only live witnesses (412 F2d 44, reh den, 416 F2d 1250).",lexis
"During the winter, in the time of a fuel shortage, the Public Service Commission of the State of New York ordered electric utilities in the state to cease all advertising promoting the use of electricity because the state's interconnected utility system did not have sufficient fuel stocks or sources of supply to meet all customer demands for the winter. Three years later, once the fuel shortage had eased, the Commission proposed to continue the ban on advertising and sought comments from the public. Notwithstanding opposition to continuation of the ban by an electric utility in the state which argued that the advertising prohibition violated the First Amendment, the Commission extended the prohibition against ""promotional"" advertising (advertising intended to stimulate the purchase of utility services) on the basis of the state's interests in conserving energy and ensuring fair and effective rates for electricity. The utility thereafter challenged the ban on advertising in the New York state courts, claiming that the Commission had restrained commercial speech in violation of the First and Fourteenth Amendments. Ultimately, the Court of Appeals of New York upheld the prohibition on advertising, concluding that the governmental interests in the prohibition outweighed the limited constitutional value of the commercial speech at issue (47 NY2d 94, 390 NE2d 749).",lexis

Ultimately, a three-judge District Court, holding that New York had been unable to demonstrate the necessity for the statute's patient identification requirement, enjoined enforcement of the provisions which require recording on the ground that the provisions violated the plaintiffs' constitutionally protected rights of privacy (403 F Supp 931).",lexis
"The prisoners contended that ¬¨√ü 3624(b) required a straightforward calculation based upon the length of the term of imprisonment that the sentencing judge imposed, not the length of time that the prisoner actually served. The U.S. Supreme Court held, however, that the method used to calculate good time credits was lawful. The method tracked the language of ¬¨√ü 3624(b) by awarding a specific number of days of credit at the end of each full year of imprisonment, if the prisoners behaved in exemplary fashion during that year, with a proration of the number of days for additional time served which was less than a full year. Basing the award of credit on the sentence imposed rather than served, as the prisoners suggested, would have resulted in the prisoners receiving good-time credit for a portion of the sentence that was not actually served with good behavior. Further, the method of calculation served as a proper incentive for the prisoners to comply with institutional disciplinary rules by awarding credit at the end of the year, after good behavior was demonstrated for a readily identifiable period.",lexis
"The San Antonio Metropolitan Transit Authority (SAMTA), a public mass-transit authority that is the major provider of transportation in the San Antonio, Texas, metropolitan area, filed an action in the United States District Court for the Western District of Texas seeking a declaratory judgment that, contrary to the determination of the Wage and Hour Administration of the Department of Labor, its operations are constitutionally immune from the application of the minimum-wage and overtime requirements of the Fair Labor Standards Act (FLSA) under National League of Cities v Usery (1976) 426 US 833, 49 L Ed 2d 245, 98 S Ct 2465, in which it was held that the commerce clause of the United States Constitution (Art I 8 cl 3) does not empower Congress to enforce such requirements against the states in areas of traditional governmental functions. The District Court entered judgment for SAMTA, holding that municipal ownership and operation of a mass-transit system is a traditional governmental function and thus, under National League of Cities, is exempt from the obligations imposed by the Fair Labor Standards Act (557 F Supp 445).",lexis
"Forsyth County, Georgia, enacted an ordinance that (1) required permits for parades, assemblies, demonstrations, and other private uses of public property, (2) required every permit applicant to pay a fee of not more than $ 1,000 for each day on which such activities were to take place, and (3) empowered the county administrator to adjust the fee's amount to meet the expense incident to the ordinance's administration and to the maintenance of public order in connection with the licensed activity. As implemented and construed by the county, the ordinance did not require the administrator to rely on any objective factors or to provide any explanation in deciding how much to charge. A private organization proposed to conduct a rally on a Saturday afternoon on courthouse steps in the county in opposition to the federal Martin Luther King, Jr. holiday. The county imposed a $ 100 fee for the rally. The organization, which did not pay the fee or hold the rally, instituted an action against the county in the United States District Court for the Northern District of Georgia, in which action the court was requested to enjoin the county from interfering with the organization's plans. The District Court, denying such injunctive relief, (1) found that the determination of the organization's fee was based solely on the content-neutral criteria of the actual costs incurred investigating and processing the application, and (2) held that the ordinance, as applied in the case at hand, was not unconstitutional. A panel of the United States Court of Appeals for the Eleventh Circuit, reversing, held that the ordinance violated the Federal Constitution's First Amendment in that the fee of up to $ 1,000 a day was more than nominal and thus exceeded the constitutional threshold (913 F2d 885). The Court of Appeals subsequently voted to vacate the panel's opinion and to rehear the case en banc (921 F2d 1125), but the Court of Appeals ultimately reinstated the panel opinion (934 F2d 1482).",lexis
"In 1964, a minor was sentenced to life imprisonment upon pleading guilty in a North Carolina prosecution for first degree burglary--an offense punishable by death under state statutes applicable at the time unless the jury recommended life imprisonment, whereas a guilty plea, if accepted, resulted in a mandatory sentence of life imprisonment under North Carolina statutes. The defendant, who had given a confession before consulting with an attorney, entered the guilty plea more than one month later, after discussion with retained counsel and the defendant's mother, and the plea was accepted after the trial court questioned the defendant and was told that the plea was tendered freely without any fear or compulsion. In 1967, the defendant sought relief from his conviction under the North Carolina Post- Conviction Hearing Act, urging that his guilty plea was the product of a coerced confession, and that the indictment to which he had pleaded was invalid because members of his race had been systematically excluded from the grand jury. After a hearing, the Superior Court of Halifax County, North Carolina, found that there had been no deliberate exclusion of Negroes from the grand jury, and that the guilty plea had been voluntarily made, without threat, coercion, or duress. The Court of Appeals of North Carolina affirmed, refusing to consider the grand jury claim, since under North Carolina law an objection to the composition of the grand jury was required to be raised by motion to quash the indictment prior to the entry of the guilty plea, which the defendant had failed to do, and also rejecting the additional assertion that the defendant's guilty plea was involuntary because North Carolina statutes at that time allowed the defendant to escape the possibility of a death penalty by pleading guilty (2 NC App 27, 162 SE2d 526).",lexis

The late fees were permitted under the law of South Dakota. The bank, moving for judgment on the pleadings, contended that the cardholder's claims were pre-empted by a provision of the National Bank Act of 1864, 12 USCS 85, which authorizes a national bank to charge interest to its loan customers at a rate allowed by the state in which the bank is located. The Superior Court of Los Angeles County, following a mandate of the California Court of Appeal, granted the bank's motion and dismissed the complaint.

"By means of electronic beepers and aerial photography, phenylacetic acid and other supplies which could be used in drug preparation were traced to the vicinity of a barn on a suspect's 198-acre ranch. The barn was located about 60 yards away from the suspect's ranch house residence, which was itself about one-half mile from a public road. The ranch had both a perimeter fence and several interior fences, including a fence which surrounded the ranch house but did not enclose the barn. On the evening of November 5, 1980, law enforcement officials, without a warrant, entered the ranch property, crossed several fences, smelled phenylacetic acid and heard a motor running, and approached the barn. The officers did not enter the barn, but, shining a flashlight, peered into the front of the barn and observed what one officer thought to be a drug laboratory. The officers left, made two similar visits on November 6, obtained a search warrant, and, on November 8, seized chemicals and equipment at the barn and ranch house. The United States District Court for the Western District of Texas denied the suspect's motion to suppress all evidence seized pursuant to the warrant, and the suspect was convicted of several federal drug-related charges. In 1982, on appeal, the United States Court of Appeals for the Fifth Circuit reversed the conviction, expressing the view that (1) the barn in question lay within the curtilage of the ranch house and thus within the protective ambit of the Fourth Amendment to the United States Constitution, (2) no other exigent circumstances existed to justify the officers' warrantless searches, and (3) the evidence gathered on November 8, by virtue of a warrant issued on the basis of information collected during the unconstitutional entries and viewings, ought to have been excluded from the case (674 F2d 1093). The United States Supreme Court (467 US 1201, 81 L Ed 2d 340, 104 S Ct 2380) vacated the judgment of the Court of Appeals for reconsideration in light of another Supreme Court Fourth Amendment decision. On remand, the Court of Appeals initially determined that (1) the barn was not within the curtilage, but (2) the conviction still ought to be reversed, because the officers, by approaching the barn and peering into it, violated the suspect's reasonable expectation of privacy in the barn, as part of the suspect's place of business (766 F2d 880). Eventually, however, after the Federal Government had filed a petition for certiorari, the Court of Appeals reinstated its original 1982 opinion, expressing the view that the barn was inside the protected curtilage (782 F2d 1226).",lexis

On the basis of false statements made by the witness before the grand jury, the witness was charged with willfully and knowingly making a false material declaration to the grand jury in violation of 18 USCS 1623. Subsequently, the United States District Court for the Western District of Texas granted the witness' motion to suppress, in the witness' perjury prosecution, his concededly false statements before the grand jury because the witness had not been given full Miranda warnings at his grand jury appearance (365 F Supp 155). The United States Court of Appeals for the Fifth Circuit affirmed, ruling that although certain warnings had been given to the witness, full Miranda warnings should have been accorded him since he was in the position of a putative defendant, and that the totality of the circumstances commanded suppression of all the testimony on which the charge of perjury rested (496 F2d 1050).",lexis

A group of royalty owners filed suit against the company in a Kansas trial court seeking recovery of interest on the delayed royalty payments, and successfully sought certification of the suit as a class action on behalf of all affected royalty owners, who resided in every state and several foreign countries and who possessed rights to leases in several states, sending notice to each of them by first-class mail that they would be included in the class unless they executed a request for exclusion, which was provided with the notice. The trial court held the company liable, applying Kansas law even though less than one percent of the leases involved were on Kansas land.

The jury that was selected convicted the defendant of the charged offense, and, in keeping with Texas' bifurcated system for capital offenses, a sentencing proceeding was then commenced. At this phase of the proceeding, the jury is required by statute to answer three questions concerning (1) whether the defendant acted deliberately in causing the death of the deceased, (2) whether there was a possibility that the defendant would continue to be a threat to society in the future, and (3) whether the defendant's conduct in killing the deceased was unreasonable in response to any provocation on the part of the deceased. If the jury finds beyond a reasonable doubt that the answer to each of these questions is yes, the court is required to impose a death sentence; otherwise, the court imposes a sentence of life imprisonment. At the defendant's punishment phase, the jury answered the statutory questions affirmatively, and the trial judge imposed the death sentence as required.

"An Act of March 2, 1889 (25 Stat 888), divided some remaining Sioux Indian territory into several reservations, including the Cheyenne River Reservation in what became the state of South Dakota, and preserved those rights of the Sioux under the Fort Laramie Treaty of 1868 (15 Stat 635) that were not in conflict with the statute. The Missouri River served as the eastern border of the Cheyenne River Reservation. While some reservation lands were held in trust by the United States for the benefit of the Cheyenne River Sioux Tribe, non-Indians acquired fee title to other reservation lands as a result of an allotment provision in the 1889 Act and other developments. The Flood Control Act of 1944 (58 Stat 887) generally authorized the establishment of a comprehensive flood control plan along the Missouri River, and in 4, codified at 16 USCS 460d, (1) directed the Chief of the United States Army Corps of Engineers to construct, maintain, and operate public park and recreational facilities in reservoir areas, (2) provided that such reservoirs would be open to public use generally, subject to such rules and regulations as the Secretary of War (later the Secretary of the Army) might deem necessary, and (3) mandated that there be ready access to and exit from such water areas for general public use. Subsequently, the United States acquired reservation lands for its Oahe Dam and Reservoir project on the Missouri River--(1) approximately 18,000 acres formerly owned in fee by non-Indians and acquired pursuant to the 1944 Act; and (2) 104,420 acres, including about 2,000 acres underlying the Missouri River, of former tribal trust lands acquired in accordance with the 1944 Act through an agreement with the tribe that was memorialized in the Cheyenne River Act of September 3, 1954 (68 Stat 1191). While 2 of the 1954 Act generally provided that the government's payment to the tribe for the former trust lands was in final and complete settlement of all claims, rights, and demands, the Act also reserved certain rights to the tribe and its members in provisions such as 10, which reserved a right of free access to the reservoir's shoreline including the right to hunt and fish, subject to regulations governing the corresponding use by other citizens of the United States. For some time, both the tribe and the state of South Dakota enforced their respective hunting and fishing regulations in the reservation lands acquired for the Oahe project. After a dispute between the tribe and the state arose, however, the state filed a suit in a Federal District Court against the tribe and a tribal official. The District Court--in enjoining the tribe and its members from exerting hunting and fishing jurisdiction over nonmembers on the acquired lands--expressed the view that (1) 10 of the 1954 Act had clearly abrogated the tribe's right to exclusive use and possession of the former trust lands; and (2) Congress had not expressly delegated to the tribe hunting and fishing jurisdiction over nonmembers on the acquired lands. On appeal, the United States Court of Appeals for the Eighth Circuit--in affirming in part, vacating in part, reversing in part, and ordering a remand--expressed the view that (1) the tribe had authority to regulate non-Indian hunting and fishing on the 104,420 acres, because the 1954 Act had not clearly expressed a congressional intent to divest the tribe of its treaty right to do so; and (2) while existing doctrine did not generally authorize the tribe to regulate non-Indian hunting and fishing on the 18,000 acres, a remand was necessary to determine whether such regulation was permissible under one of the exceptions to the general doctrine (949 F2d 984).",lexis

"Under the National Guard's dual enlistment system, all persons who enlist in a state National Guard unit simultaneously enlist in a federal reserve component, the Army National Guard of the United States or the Air National Guard of the United States. The consent of the appropriate governor is generally required, under 10 USCS 672(b), 672(d), for a National Guard of the United States active-duty training mission. In 1986, however, after some governors had refused to consent to National Guard training missions in Central America, Congress enacted the Montgomery Amendment (10 USCS 672(f)), which provides that such gubernatorial consent may not be withheld, in whole or in part, with regard to active duty outside the United States, its territories, and its possessions because of any objection to the location, purpose, type, or schedule of such active duty. The Governor of Minnesota filed suit in the United States District Court for the District of Minnesota against several federal defendants and alleged that the Montgomery Amendment (1) had prevented the Governor from withholding his consent to a training mission in Central America for certain members of the Minnesota National Guard; and (2) violated the Federal Constitution's two militia clauses, which provide (a) in Art I, 8, cl 15, that Congress shall have the power to provide for calling forth the militia to execute the laws of the Union, suppress insurrections, and repel invasions, and (b) in Art I, 8, cl 16, that Congress shall have the power to provide for organizing, arming, and disciplining the militia, and for governing such part of them as may be employed in the service of the United States, reserving to the states, respectively, the appointment of the officers and the authority of training the militia according to the discipline prescribed by Congress. The District Court, however, rejecting the Governor's challenge, expressed the view that, even though units of the National Guard of the United States, a federal organization, also maintain an identity as state National Guard units, such fact does not limit Congress' authority to train the National Guard when the National Guard is called to active federal service (666 F Supp 1319). On appeal, a panel of the United States Court of Appeals for the Eighth Circuit reached a contrary conclusion and read the militia clauses as preserving state authority over the training of the National Guard and its membership, unless and until Congress determined that there was some sort of exigency or extraordinary need to exert federal power. On rehearing en banc, however, the Court of Appeals, vacating the panel decision and affirming the District Court's judgment, expressed the view that the state's authority to train the militia did not conflict with Congress' power to raise armies for the common defense and to control the training of federal reserve forces (880 F2d 11).",lexis

"In 2003, a police detective tried to question the inmate, who was incarcerated at a Maryland prison pursuant to a prior conviction, about allegations that he had sexually abused his son. The inmate invoked his Miranda right to have counsel present during interrogation, so the interview was terminated. The inmate was released back into the general prison population, and the investigation was closed. Another detective reopened the investigation in 2006 and attempted to interrogate the inmate, who was still incarcerated. The inmate waived his Miranda rights and made inculpatory statements. The Court held that extending the Edwards presumption was not justified. It held that a 14 day break-in-custody provided plenty of time for a suspect to get reacclimated to his normal life, to consult with friends and counsel, and to shake off any residual coercive effects of his prior custody. The inherently compelling pressures of custodial interrogation ended when the inmate returned to his normal prison life, so his release back into the general prison population after the 2003 interview constituted a break in custody. The two-and-a-half year break was long enough to render Edwards inapplicable.",lexis
"Several abortion clinics, and organizations that supported the operation of such clinics, sued, under 42 USCS 1985(3)--which provides a cause of action for damages, if two or more persons conspire for the purpose of (1) depriving, either directly or indirectly, any person or class of persons of equal protection of the laws or equal privileges and immunities under the laws, or (2) preventing or hindering the constituted authorities of any state or territory from giving or securing the equal protection of the laws--and under state law, to enjoin the conduct of demonstrations at abortion clinics in the Washington, D.C., metropolitan area by an association and individuals who organized, in various parts of the country, antiabortion demonstrations in which participants trespassed on, and obstructed general access to, the premises of abortion clinics.

Nevertheless, the Justice Department advised the Kentucky Appeal Board that the claim should be denied for failure to satisfy each of the three basic tests for qualification as a conscientious objector.

"Four indigent inmates in a federal prison were placed in administrative detention during the investigation of the murder of a fellow inmate and they remained there for approximately 19 months before they were indicted and arraigned, at which time counsel was appointed for them. Before trial, they filed a motion to dismiss the indictments on the ground that their administrative confinement without the appointment of counsel violated their Sixth Amendment right to counsel. The District Court for the Central District of California denied their motion, and they were ultimately convicted of murder and conspiracy to commit murder. In a similar case, two other inmates were placed in administrative detention for approximately 8 months without appointment of counsel during the investigation of the murder of another inmate. Counsel was subsequently appointed for them upon their arraignment on a federal indictment. Before trial, they also filed a motion to dismiss the indictments on the ground that their administrative confinement without appointment of counsel violated their Sixth Amendment right to counsel.

The United States Court of Appeals for the Ninth Circuit, proceeding en banc, consolidated the appeals of all six inmates and reversed, holding that the inmates had a Sixth Amendment right to counsel during the period in which they were held in administrative detention before the return of indictments against them, and that because they had been denied that right, their convictions had to be overturned and their indictments dismissed (704 F2d 1116).",lexis
"The Price-Anderson Act imposes a $ 560 million limitation on liability for nuclear accidents resulting from the operation of federally licensed private nuclear power plants (42 USCS 2210). An environmental organization, a labor union, and a number of individuals residing near certain planned nuclear power plants sued the Nuclear Regulatory Commission and the investor-owned public utility constructing the power plants, seeking a declaration that the Act was unconstitutional as constituting arbitrary governmental action adversely affecting their property rights in violation of the due process clause of the Fifth Amendment, and as being an instrument of taking without any assurance of just compensation in the event of a nuclear accident. The United States District Court for the Western District of North Carolina held that the plaintiffs had standing to challenge the Act's constitutionality and that their claim could be properly adjudicated. The District Court then held that the Act violated the due process clause because it allowed injuries to occur without assuring adequate compensation to the victims, and violated the equal protection component of the Fifth Amendment by forcing victims of nuclear incidents to bear the burden of injury, whereas society as a whole benefited from the existence of nuclear power (431 F Supp 203).",lexis

After parallel trials of the separate actions, the District Court concluded that the evidence showed an unacceptably high number of incidents of police misconduct, for which the defendants should be held responsible because of their failure to act in the face of the statistical ""pattern"" of misconduct, and entered an order requiring the defendants to submit for the court's approval a program for improving the handling of citizen complaints alleging police misconduct, in accordance with guidelines contained in the court's opinion (357 F Supp 1289).

"In 1952, an inventor was hired by an aircraft manufacturing company to develop for it a more accurate gyroscope, which he soon did. In 1954, the inventor applied for a patent on his ideas, and in 1955 he entered into a licensing contract by which the company agreed to pay royalties for his improvements until such time as the patent application might be refused or the patent held invalid. In 1957, after the inventor's patent application had been rejected twice, the company announced that it would no longer pay royalties on some of its gyroscopes, and the company terminated all royalties to the inventor in 1959. Upon finally obtaining his patent in 1960, the inventor brought suit in the California Superior Court, claiming that the company's termination of royalties was a breach of both the 1955 contract and of its quasi-contractual obligations. Although the company sought to raise patent invalidity as a defense, the trial judge directed a verdict for the inventor in regard to the royalties on some of the gyroscopes, holding that the company was estopped by its licensing agreement from questioning the inventor's patent. The California Court of Appeal held that the company was within its contractual rights in terminating its royalty obligations entirely in 1959, but that the contract required the company to pay the pre-1959 royalties regardless of the validity of the patent (52 Cal Rptr 795). The California Supreme Court rejected the Court of Appeal's conclusion that the contract gave the company the right to terminate its royalty obligations in 1959, holding that since the contract was still in effect, the doctrine of estoppel barred the company from questioning the propriety of the Patent Office's grant (67 Cal 2d 882, 64 Cal Rptr 545, 435 P2d 321).",lexis
"In response to racial tension in a community and its schools, the Board of Education and the teachers union in Jackson, Michigan added a provision to their collective bargaining agreement under which, if it were to become necessary to lay off teachers, those with the most seniority would be retained, except that at no time would there be a greater percentage of minority teachers laid off than the percentage of minority teachers employed at the time of the layoff. This provision was designed to preserve the effects of a hiring policy whose goal had been to increase the percentage of minority teachers in the school system. When layoffs became necessary, the board adhered to the provision, with the result that certain nonminority teachers were laid off while minority teachers with less seniority were retained. The displaced nonminority teachers brought suit in United States District Court for the Eastern District of Michigan, alleging violation of the equal protection clause of the Fourteenth Amendment. The District Court dismissed the teachers' claims, holding that the racial preferences were permissible as an attempt to remedy societal discrimination by providing role models for minority schoolchildren (546 F Supp 1195).

The picketing was conducted under police supervision some 1,000 feet from the church, out of the sight of those at the church.

"Prior to 1990, one of Georgia's 10 congressional districts was a majority-minority district, in which the majority of the district's voters were black. Following the 1990 census, the Georgia state legislature enacted a congressional redistricting plan which created a new Eleventh District, which contained a majority of black citizens. Because Georgia was designated as a covered jurisdiction under 4(b) of the Voting Rights Act of 1965 (42 USCS 1973b(b)), the plan was submitted to the Attorney General of the United States for preclearance under 5 of the Act (42 USCS 1973c). The Department of Justice objected to the plan, noting a concern that (1) Georgia had created only two majority-minority districts, and (2) the plan did not recognize certain minority populations. The legislature enacted a second plan, and the Justice Department again refused preclearance, relying on alternative plans proposing three majority-minority districts, one of which, referred to as the ""max-black"" plan, had been drafted by a civil liberties organization for the Georgia legislature's black caucus. The Justice Department's refusal concluded that Georgia had failed to explain adequately its failure to create a third majority-minority district. Consequently, the Georgia legislature, using the ""max-black"" plan as a benchmark, enacted a new plan, containing three majority-minority districts. Under the new plan, the Eleventh District connected the black neighborhoods of metropolitan Atlanta, and other centers of population, with the poor black populace of coastal areas 260 miles away. The plan received Justice Department preclearance. A number of white voters in the Eleventh District brought suit in the United States District Court for the Southern District of Georgia, alleging that the Eleventh District (1) was a racial gerrymander, and (2) so violated the equal protection clause of the Federal Constitution's Fourteenth Amendment as interpreted by the United States Supreme Court in Shaw v Reno (1993) 509 US ____, 125 L Ed 2d 511, 113 S Ct 2816. A three-judge panel of the District Court found that the Eleventh District was invalid under Shaw v Reno, in that (1) Shaw v Reno required strict scrutiny whenever race is the overriding, predominant force in the redistricting process, (2) race was the overriding, predominant force in Georgia's redistricting plan, and (3) under strict scrutiny, even if it were assumed that compliance with the Voting Rights Act would be a compelling interest, (a) the Act did not require three majority-black districts, and (b) Georgia's plan therefore was not narrowly tailored to the goal of complying with the Act (864 F Supp 1354).",lexis

The California Court of Appeal affirmed (117 Cal App 3d 36, 172 Cal Rptr 430), but the California Supreme Court reversed, holding that the search of the motor home was unreasonable because no warrant was obtained and that the vehicle exception to the warrant requirement did not apply, because the expectations of privacy in a motor home are more like those in a dwelling than in an automobile.",lexis

Once the state appellate court reopened direct review of the inmate's conviction, his conviction was no longer final for purposes of _ 2244(d)(1)(A).

"A British drug manufacturer held an American patent on the dosage form of griseofulvin, a fungicide, and another British drug manufacturer held an American patent on a microsize dosage form of griseofulvin. The two manufacturers made a patent pooling agreement containing certain restrictions on the sale of bulk-form griseofulvin. Similar bulk-sale restrictions were contained in sublicensing agreements made by the two manufacturers with three American drug companies. In a civil antitrust action in the United States District Court for the District of Columbia, the United States Government sought to enjoin enforcement of the bulk-sale restrictions on the ground that they involved unreasonable restraints of trade, in violation of 1 of the Sherman Act. Also, the government challenged the validity of the American patents which had been obtained by the British manufacturers. The District Court held that the bulk-sales restrictions constituted per se violations of 1 of the Sherman Act, but that since the manufacturers were not relying on the patents in defense of the government's antitrust claims, the government could not challenge the validity of the patents (302 F Supp 1). Although the District Court granted the government's request for injunctive relief against future violations, the District Court denied the government's request that the manufacturers be ordered (1) to make bulk sales on reasonable and nondiscriminatory terms and prices to all bona fide applicants, and (2) to grant reasonable-royalty licenses for the manufacture of griseofulvin (328 F Supp 709).",lexis
"A regulation of the State University of New York generally prohibited the operation of private commercial enterprises in student dormitories. A company marketed housewares to college students by means of a demonstration and offer of products for sale to groups of 10 or more prospective buyers at gatherings assembled and hosted by one of those buyers, for which the host or hostess stood to receive some bonus or reward. After a company representative who had been conducting such a presentation in a student's dormitory room at a state university campus refused to leave upon request by the campus police, the police arrested the representative and charged her with trespass, soliciting without a permit, and loitering. Several students then sued various university-related officials and entities in the United States District Court for the Northern District of New York and sought a declaratory judgment that the regulation violated the Federal Constitution's First Amendment, in prohibiting the students (1) from hosting and attending company demonstrations, and (2) from having discussions with other ""commercial invitees"" in the students' rooms.

"Under an 1854 treaty, an Indian tribe received certain lands on the west bank of the Missouri River which, at the time, were part of the Territory of Nebraska. The eastern boundary of the reservation was fixed as the center of the main channel of the Missouri River. In 1867, a survey established that the reservation included a large peninsula jutting east toward the Iowa side of the river, around which the river flowed. In subsequent years the river changed course several times, and, since 1927, has been west of its 1867 position, leaving most of the survey area on the Iowa side of the river, and separated from the rest of the reservation. Iowa residents eventually settled on the land, but, in 1975, were dispossessed by the tribe with assistance from the Bureau of Indian Affairs. Following the seizure, three federal actions were instituted against, among others, the state of Iowa and several individuals by the Indian tribe and the United States as trustee of the land. These actions, in which both sides sought to quiet title in their names, were consolidated in the United States District Court for the Northern District of Iowa. Initially, the District Court concluded that state law, rather than federal law, should be the basis of decision. The court then determined that 25 USCS 194, which provides that, in all property disputes between Indians and ""white persons,"" the burden of proof rests with the white person whenever the Indian makes out a presumption of title in himself from the fact of previous possession or ownership, was inapplicable, since the tribe could not prove that it had previously possessed the land in question without proving its case on the merits. Applying Nebraska law, which places the burden of proof on the party seeking to quiet title, the court decided that the key changes in the river had been accretive, as opposed to avulsive, and that therefore the defendant east-bank riparians were the owners of the disputed area (433 F Supp 67). The United States Court of Appeals for the Eighth Circuit reversed, holding that the District Court should have applied federal rather than state law, and that the District Court had erred by refusing to apply 25 USCS 194. The Court of Appeals concluded that, by applying federal common law relative to accretion and avulsion, the evidence was in equipoise, and therefore, under 194, judgment for the Indian tribe was proper (575 F2d 620).",lexis

The jury historically played no role in a decision to impose sentences consecutively or concurrently, the choice rested exclusively with the judge, and thus _ 137.123 did not erode any traditional function of the jury.

"Inmates of a federally-operated, short-term custodial facility, designed primarily to house pretrial detainees, brought a class action in the United States District Court for the Southern District of New York by filing in the District Court a writ of habeas corpus to challenge numerous conditions of confinement and practices at the facility.

"A conscientious objector, who had satisfactorily completed two years of alternative civilian service, and who had thereafter been denied educational benefits under the Veterans' Readjustment Benefits Act of 1966 (38 USCS 1651-1697), instituted a class action against the Veterans' Administration and the Administrator of Veterans Affairs in the United States District Court for the District of Massachusetts, seeking a declaratory judgment that the statutory scheme's restriction of educational benefits to veterans who had served on active duty violated the First Amendment guarantee of religious freedom and equal protection principles as encompassed under the due process clause of the Fifth Amendment. The defendants moved to dismiss the action on the ground that the District Court lacked jurisdiction because of the provisions of 38 USCS 211(a) prohibiting judicial review of decisions of the Administrator of Veterans Affairs on questions of law or fact under any law administered by the Veterans' Administration which provides for veterans' benefits. Denying the motion to dismiss, the District Court held that although the statutory scheme did not violate First Amendment rights, nevertheless it was unconstitutional as violative of Fifth Amendment equal protection (352 F Supp 848).",lexis

"The Necessary and Proper Clause granted Congress broad authority to criminalize conduct, imprison those who engaged in that conduct, and enact laws governing prisons and prisoners in the course of ""carrying into Execution"" the enumerated powers ""vested by"" the ""Constitution in the Government of the U.S.,""--authority granted by the Necessary and Proper Clause. Section 4248 was a modest addition to a set of federal prison-related mental-health statutes that had existed for many decades, aside from its focus on sexually dangerous persons. The desire to address the specific challenges identified with mentally ill, sexually dangerous federal prisoners, taken together with U.S. responsibilities as a federal custodian with the constitutional power to act to protect communities from the danger its prisoners could pose, satisfied a rational means review. Powers granted by the Necessary and Proper Clause were, by definition, not powers ""reserved to the States"" under U.S. Const. amend. X, and, ¬¨√ü 4248 even required accommodation of state interests. Section 4248 was not too sweeping in scope. From the implied power to punish, the federal civil-commitment power was inferred.",lexis

"The PLRA did not state exhaustion had to be pleaded by the inmate, thus evidencing that the usual practice should be followed which was to regard exhaustion as an affirmative defense. The screening requirement did not justify deviating from the usual procedure beyond that in the PLRA. There was no basis to conclude that Congress implicitly transformed exhaustion from an affirmative defense to a pleading requirement by specifying that courts should screen PLRA complaints and dismiss those that failed to state a claim. Section 1997e(g)(1) allowed defendants to waive responses without admitting the allegations notwithstanding any other law or procedural rule, thus showing that when Congress meant to depart from the usual procedure, it did so expressly. Failure to exhaust was an affirmative defense under the PLRA, and inmates were not required to plead exhaustion in their complaints. The rule that each defendant later sued had to have been named in initial grievances lacked a textual basis in the PLRA and prison policy did not specify who a grievance had to name. Dismissal under the total exhaustion rule was error as failure to exhaust one claim did not necessarily affect others.",lexis

The United States Court of Appeals for the Tenth Circuit affirmed but remanded for an appropriate modification of the injunctive decree, holding that the NCAA television plan constituted illegal per se price fixing, and that even if the television plan was not per se illegal, its anticompetitive limitation on price and output was not offset by any procompetitive justification sufficient to save the plan even when the totality of the circumstances was examined (707 F2d 1147).",lexis

"Members of the Satmar Hasidic sect, practitioners of a strict form of Judaism, incorporated the village of Kiryas Joel within the town of Monroe, New York, pursuant to a New York statute which gave almost any group of residents who satisfied various procedures the right to form a new village. Children in the village generally were educated in private religious schools, but the public school district within which the village fell provided special services to the village's handicapped children at an annex to one of the private schools. After this arrangement was ended in response to United States Supreme Court decisions holding unconstitutional a state's provision of supplemental educational services in sectarian schools, village children in need of such services were sent to public schools outside the village. However, parents of most of these children withdrew them from such schools on the ground that the children suffered panic, fear, and trauma in leaving their own community and being with people with different ways. In 1989, the New York state legislature passed a statute constituting the village as a separate public school district. The Governor of New York, in signing the bill into law, acknowledged that the village school district's residents were all members of the same religious sect. Although the village district had plenary legal authority over the elementary and secondary education of all school-aged children in the village, the district ran only one public school, which provided a special education program for handicapped children. An action challenging the statute's constitutionality was brought in the New York State Supreme Court for Albany County by the state school boards association and officers of the association against the state education department and various state officials. The state Supreme Court, in granting summary judgment to the association and its officers, concluded that the statute violated the establishment of religion clause of the Federal Constitution's First Amendment (151 Misc 2d 60, 579 NYS2d 1004). The Appellate Division of the state Supreme Court (1) recognized the standing of the association's officers to challenge the statute in their individual capacities as citizen-taxpayers; and (2) affirmed the state Supreme Court's decision on the ground that the statute had the primary effect of advancing religion (187 App Div 2d 16, 592 NYS2d 123).

Pursuant to the plaintiff's motion under 10 Del C 366, the court sequestered certain property, primarily stock, of a number of the nonresident individual defendants. The defendants contended, inter alia, that they did not have sufficient contacts with Delaware to sustain the jurisdiction of that state's courts, but the Court of Chancery ruled that the situs of the stock, which was by Delaware statute considered to be within that state, provided a sufficient basis for the exercise of quasi in rem jurisdiction by a Delaware Court.

"Under a Connecticut statute, the prejudgment attachment of real property without a hearing is allowed upon the filing of an affidavit which shows that there is ""probable cause"" to sustain the validity of the plaintiff's claims. In conjunction with the prejudgment attachment statute, other provisions of Connecticut law include (1) an ""expeditious"" postattachment adversary hearing; (2) notice for such hearing; (3) judicial review of an adverse decision; and (4) a double damages action if the original suit is commenced without probable cause. Pursuant to the prejudgment attachment statute, a party who sought to institute an action for assault and battery in Connecticut Superior Court submitted an application for an ex parte attachment in the amount of $ 75,000 on the Connecticut home of the alleged tortfeasor. The tort claimant, who did not have any interest in any of the alleged tortfeasor's property, stated in an affidavit that the alleged tortfeasor had assaulted him, that the claimant had sustained certain injuries and medical expenses, and that in the claimant's opinion the facts were sufficient to show that there was probable cause that judgment on the assault and battery claim would be rendered for the claimant. The Superior Court found ""probable cause"" to sustain the validity of the claim, and ordered attachment on the alleged tortfeasor's home to the value of $ 75,000. Four days later--before the alleged tortfeasor had received notice of the attachment and before he had been served with the complaint on the assault and battery claim--the sheriff attached the property. In response, the alleged tortfeasor filed suit against the tort claimant in the United States District Court for the District of Connecticut, in which suit the alleged tortfeasor claimed that the Connecticut prejudgment attachment statute was unconstitutional under the due process clause of the Federal Constitution's Fourteenth Amendment. The Federal District Court upheld the statute and granted summary judgment in favor of the tort claimant (716 F Supp 58). On appeal--and after the state of Connecticut had been allowed to intervene--a panel of the United States Court of Appeals for the Second Circuit, reversing, expressed the view that the Connecticut statute violated due process in permitting ex parte attachment without a hearing absent a showing of extraordinary circumstances; however, two of the three panel members rejected the view that the statute also violated the due process clause by failing to require that a plaintiff post a bond for the defendant's protection in the event that the prejudgment attachment was ultimately found to have been improvident (898 F2d 852).",lexis

"A female nonveteran who had taken and passed a number of open competitive examinations for civil service positions with the state of Massachusetts failed to secure employment for positions on several occasions because of the Massachusetts Veterans Preference Statute, which grants an absolute lifetime preference to veterans by requiring that ""any person, male or female, including a nurse,"" qualifying for a civil service position, who was honorably discharged from the United States Armed Forces after at least 90 days of active service, at least one day of which was during wartime, must be considered for appointment to a civil service position ahead of any qualifying nonveterans. Alleging that the absolute preference formula, by inevitably operating to exclude women from consideration for the best Massachusetts civil service jobs, denied women equal protection of the laws in violation of the United States Constitution, the woman brought an action in the United States District Court for the District of Massachusetts. The District Court declared the law unconstitutional and enjoined its operation (415 F Supp 485), but on direct appeal from the decision of the three-judge District Court, the United States Supreme Court vacated the judgment and remanded the case for further consideration in light of an intervening Supreme Court decision holding that a neutral law does not violate the Fourteenth Amendment's equal protection clause solely because it results in a racially disproportionate impact, it being necessary to trace such disproportionate impact to a purpose to discriminate. On remand, the District Court reaffirmed its original judgment, concluding that a veterans' hiring preference is inherently nonneutral because it favors a class from which women have traditionally been excluded, and that the consequences of the Massachusetts absolute preference formula for the employment opportunities of women were too inevitable to have been unintended (451 F Supp 143).",lexis

The Court, however, held that the domestic relationship did not have to be a defining element of the predicate offense. The definition of ""misdemeanor crime of domestic violence"" contained in 18 U.S.C.S. _ 921(a)(33)(A) did not require the predicate-offense statute to include, as an element, the existence of the domestic relationship.

Prior to the penalty phase of the trial, the prosecution gave notice that it intended to introduce expert testimony regarding the origin and nature of a prison gang known as the Aryan Brotherhood, as well as the fact that the defendant had the words ""Aryan Brotherhood"" tattooed on his hand; but the defense argued that this evidence was inflammatory and irrelevant and that its admission would violate the defendant's rights under the Federal Constitution's First and Fourteenth Amendments. In return for the prosecution's agreement not to call its expert witnesses, the defendant agreed to a stipulation stating that (1) the Aryan Brotherhood was a white racist prison gang that began in California in the 1960s in response to gangs of racial minorities, and (2) separate gangs calling themselves the Aryan Brotherhood existed in many state prisons, including Delaware's. At the penalty hearing, the prosecution read the stipulation to the jury and introduced evidence regarding the defendant's tattoo and his lengthy criminal record, while the defense offered mitigating testimony from family members and noted that the defendant had earned good time credits in prison for enrolling in drug and alcohol programs. The jury (1) found, as aggravating circumstances, that the murder had been committed (a) by an escaped prisoner, (b) during the commission of a burglary, and (c) for pecuniary gain; (2) determined that the aggravating evidence outweighed the mitigating evidence; and accordingly (3) issued a binding recommendation that the defendant be sentenced to death. The Supreme Court of Delaware, affirming, (1) stated that punishing a person for expressing his views or associating with certain people was substantially different from allowing evidence of a defendant's character to be considered where that character was a relevant inquiry, and (2) concluded that, because the Aryan Brotherhood evidence properly focused the jury's attention on the defendant's character, that evidence was properly introduced during the penalty hearing (581 A2d 1078).",lexis

"A regulated Indiana utility that generated and sold electricity, and was an accrual-basis taxpayer, required residential and commercial customers with suspect credit to make deposits with the utility to insure prompt payment of future utility bills. Prior to the termination of service, a customer, by demonstrating acceptable credit, could obtain a refund made in cash or by check, or could, at the customer's option, have the deposit applied against future bills. After a certain period, the utility paid interest on the deposits, which ordinarily were twice the customers' estimated monthly bills, were commingled with other receipts, and were at all times subject to the utility's unfettered use and control. Rather than treating the deposits as income at the time of receipt, the utility carried the deposits on its books as current liabilities and made the necessary accounting adjustments to recognize income when a deposit was used to offset a customer's bill. Upon audit of the utility's federal income tax returns, the Commissioner of Internal Revenue asserted tax deficiencies for the years 1975 through 1977, based on the position that the deposits were advance payments for electricity and therefore were taxable in the year of receipt.

The accused was convicted by a jury in an Arizona state court of first-degree murder. The evidence showed that (1) the accused and his two codefendants robbed the victim at gunpoint; (2) they forced him into his car and drove out into the desert; (3) the victim was frightened; (4) the accused took a gun, went off with the victim into the desert, and shot him once in the head; and (5) the accused told his codefendants that he had shot the victim and that he had ""never seen a man pee in his pants before."" At the accused's sentencing hearing, the prosecution argued that two statutory aggravating circumstances were present, in that the murder was committed (1) ""in an especially heinous, cruel or depraved manner,"" and (2) for pecuniary gain. In mitigation, the accused (1) offered testimony from a psychiatrist to the effect that the accused had a long history of substance abuse which impaired his judgment and might have been sexually abused as a child, and (2) argued his age (20 years at the time of sentencing). At the conclusion of the hearing, the trial court (1) found that the two aggravating circumstances asserted by the prosecution were present; (2) stated that it had considered the accused's capacity to appreciate the wrongfulness of his conduct, as well as all of the mitigating factors urged by his counsel; (3) concluded that there were no mitigating circumstances sufficiently substantial to call for leniency; and accordingly, (4) sentenced the accused to death. The Supreme Court of Arizona, in affirming the accused's conviction and sentence, conducted an independent review of the sentence in which it (1) noted, with reference to the ""especially heinous, cruel or depraved"" circumstance, that it had determined in prior cases that (a) a murder is committed in an especially cruel manner when the perpetrator inflicts mental anguish or physical abuse before the victim's death, (b) mental anguish includes a victim's uncertainty as to his ultimate fate, and (c) a depraved murder is one where the perpetrator relishes the murder, evidencing debasement or perversion; (2) found that there was sufficient evidence to conclude that the victim suffered mental anguish before his death, and that the accused had relished the murder; (3) found that the pecuniary gain circumstance was present; (4) examined the mitigating evidence and concluded that there were no mitigating circumstances sufficient to call for leniency; and (5) determined that the accused's death sentence was proportional to sentences imposed in similar cases (159 Ariz 571, 769 P2d 1017).",lexis

In accordance with the Bank Merger Act of 1960 (12 USC 1828(c)), an application for approval of the merger was filed with, and approved by, the Comptroller of the Currency. The United States then brought the present civil action in the United States District Court for the Eastern District of Pennsylvania to enjoin the merger as violating 1 of the Sherman Act and 7 of the Clayton Act (15 USC 18), which in its pertinent part prohibits the acquisition by one corporation of the stock of another where in any line of commerce in any section of the country, the effect of such acquisition may be substantially to lessen competition, or to tend to create a monopoly.

"While living on the reservation of the Salt River Pima-Maricopa Indian Community, an enrolled member of a second Indian tribe allegedly shot and killed, on the reservation, a member of a third Indian tribe. As a nonmember of the Pima-Maricopa tribe, the accused was not entitled to vote in Pima-Maricopa elections, to hold tribal office, or to serve on tribal juries. After the accused was charged with murder, in violation of the Major Crimes Act (18 USCS 1153), which provides federal jurisdiction over major felonies, including murder, committed by Indians in Indian country, the federal indictment against the accused was dismissed without prejudice on the motion of the United States Attorney. The accused then was placed in the custody of Pima-Maricopa officers and was taken to stand trial before the Pima-Maricopa Indian Community Court. Under the tribal criminal code, which was confined to misdemeanors, the accused was charged with the illegal firing of a weapon on the reservation. After the tribal court denied the accused's motion to dismiss the prosecution for lack of jurisdiction, the accused filed a petition for habeas corpus in the United States District Court for the District of Arizona. The District Court, in granting the writ of habeas corpus, expressed the view that the assertion of jurisdiction by the tribe over an Indian who was not a member of the tribe would violate the equal protection guarantees of the Indian Civil Rights Act (25 USCS 1302 et seq.), because to subject a nonmember Indian to tribal jurisdiction, from which non-Indians were exempt, would constitute discrimination based on race. On appeal, the United States Court of Appeals for the Ninth Circuit, revising its earlier opinion in the case (821 F2d 1358), reversed the judgment of the District Court and expressed the view that Indian tribes, without regard to tribal membership, retained jurisdiction over minor crimes committed by Indians against other Indians (851 F2d 1136). Subsequently, the Court of Appeals denied the accused's request for a rehearing (860 F2d 1463).",lexis

"Even after ""dual"" public school systems--that is, systems which were racially segregated by law--had been held to violate the equal protection clause of the Federal Constitution's Fourteenth Amendment, Mississippi's dual public university system, composed of five historically white and three historically black institutions, remained largely segregated. In 1963, the state's three ""flagship"" historically white universities enacted a policy requiring all entrants to achieve a minimum score of 15 on a particular college admissions test, at a time when the average score was 18 for whites and 7 for blacks. In 1975, private plaintiffs filed a suit--in which the United States intervened as plaintiff--in the United States District Court for the Northern District of Mississippi and alleged that state officials had failed to satisfy their obligations, under provisions including the Fourteenth Amendment and Title VI of the Civil Rights Act of 1964 (42 USCS 2000d), to dismantle Mississippi's dual system of higher education. The parties attempted to achieve a consensual resolution through voluntary dismantlement. In 1981, the state assigned its universities three categories of missions: (1) ""comprehensive""--the three flagship universities--with the greatest resources and program offerings; (2) ""urban""--the sole urban university, historically black--with a more limited mission geared toward the urban setting; and (3) ""regional""--the remaining four universities, two historically white and two historically black--with primarily an undergraduate role. By the mid-1980's, the student bodies of the state's universities were still predominantly white or black according to whether the universities were historically white or black, but the District Court ruled that the case ought to be dismissed, as the court expressed the view that (1) in the higher education context, the state's affirmative duty to desegregate did not contemplate either the restriction of choice or the achievement of any degree of racial balance; (2) while student enrollment and faculty and staff hiring patterns had to be examined, greater emphasis ought to be placed on current state higher education policies and practices in order to insure that they (a) were racially neutral, (b) had been developed and implemented in good faith, and (c) did not substantially contribute to the continued racial identifiability of the individual institutions; and (3) the current actions of Mississippi officials demonstrated that they were fulfilling their duty (674 F Supp 1523). On appeal, a panel of the United States Court of Appeals for the Fifth Circuit ordered a reversal and remand, on the ground that Mississippi had not complied with its duty to eliminate all of the vestiges of segregation, root and branch, in the public university system (893 F2d 732). On rehearing en banc, however, the Court of Appeals affirmed the District Court's decision and expressed the view that Mississippi had discharged its duty to dismantle its dual system of higher education, because the record made it clear that (1) the state had adopted and implemented race-neutral policies for operating its universities, and (2) all students had real freedom of choice to attend the university that the students wished (914 F2d 676).",lexis
"Growers and handlers of Florida avocados brought suit in the United States District Court for the Northern District of California to enjoin California state officials from enforcing a California statute prohibiting the transportation or sale in California of avocados containing less than 8 percent of oil, by weight, excluding the skin and seed. A three-judge court denied an injunction against the enforcement of the California statute, holding that (1) federal marketing orders, adopted pursuant to the Agricultural Adjustment Act (7 USC 601 et seq.), did not displace the California statute even though the federal marketing orders made picking dates, sizes, and weights the maturity test for South Florida avocados; (2) the application of the California statute did not deny Florida avocado growers and handlers the equal protection of the laws; and (3) the application of the California statute did not unreasonably burden or discriminate against interstate marketing of Florida avocados. As to (3), the District Court did not clearly rule on the admissibility of depositions and exhibits offered by the Florida growers and handlers to show an unconstitutional burden on interstate commerce, and did not indicate that the growers and handlers would not have been entitled to relief even if the evidence were admitted.

Both parties appealed to the United States Supreme Court, the Florida growers and handlers contending in No. 45 that the lower court erred in not enjoining enforcement of the California statute against Florida avocados, and the California officials contending in No. 49 that the action should have been dismissed for want of equity jurisdiction rather than upon the merits.",lexis
"A man who took part in a street fight was accused of attempted murder and was tried in the Circuit Court of Cook County, Illinois. Well in advance of trial, the prosecutor filed a discovery motion requesting a list of defense witnesses. On the first day of trial, defense counsel was allowed to amend his ""answer to discovery"" by adding the names of two eyewitnesses, neither of whom was called to testify. On the second day of trial, after the prosecution's principal witnesses had completed their testimony, defense counsel made an oral motion to amend his answer to discovery to include two additional witnesses. In support of the motion, counsel represented that he had just been informed about these witnesses and that they had probably seen the entire incident in question. In response to the court's inquiry, counsel acknowledged that the accused had previously told him about the two additional witnesses, but said that the accused had not been able to locate the second one. On the next day, the second witness appeared in court with defense counsel, who was permitted to make an offer of proof in the form of the second witness' testimony outside the presence of the jury. It developed that this witness (1) had not seen the incident itself, (2) had first met the accused more than 2 years after the incident, and (3) had been visited by defense counsel at his home during the week before the trial began. The trial judge, finding that the discovery rules had been violated and that the witness' veracity was doubtful, precluded the witness' testimony as a sanction for the discovery violation. The accused was convicted, and the Illinois Appellate Court, First District, affirmed, holding that the trial court had been within its discretion in refusing to allow the witness to testify (141 Ill App 3d 839, 96 Ill Dec 189, 491 NE2d 3). Upon filing a petition for rehearing in the Appellate Court, the accused for the first time specifically articulated his claim as based on the right of a criminal defendant, under the Federal Constitution's Sixth Amendment, to have compulsory process for obtaining witnesses in his or her favor.

"A United States Supreme Court case arose concerning race-based affirmative action in federal contracting. Previously, in Richmond v J. A. Croson Co. (1989) 488 US 469, 102 L Ed 2d 854, 109 S Ct 706, which had a majority opinion only in part, the Supreme Court had held that (1) under the equal protection clause of the Federal Constitution's Fourteenth Amendment, strict scrutiny had to be applied to governmental classification by race, regardless of whether the classification's asserted purpose was ""remedial"" or ""benign""; and (2) the equal protection clause was violated by a city's 30 percent set-aside plan for minority business utilization in construction contracts. However, in Fullilove v Klutznick (1980) 448 US 448, 65 L Ed 2d 902, 100 S Ct 2758, the Supreme Court, by a majority result without a majority opinion, in effect held that with respect to federal funds for some local public works projects, a federal statute's general requirement of a 10 percent set-aside for minority businesses did not facially violate the equal protection component of the due process clause of the Constitution's Fifth Amendment. Also, in Metro Broadcasting v FCC (1990) 497 US 547, 111 L Ed 2d 445, 110 S Ct 2997, which had a majority opinion, the Supreme Court (1) adopted intermediate scrutiny as the standard of review for congressionally mandated ""benign"" racial classifications; and (2) held that some minority preference policies with respect to federal broadcast licenses did not violate the Fifth Amendment's equal protection component. The case at hand involved ""subcontractor compensation clauses"" in federal agency contracts, where (1) such clauses generally provided that a general or prime contractor would receive additional compensation for hiring subcontractors certified as small businesses owned and controlled by ""socially and economically disadvantaged individuals""; and (2) the Federal Government, under laws other than the statute at issue in Fullilove v Klutznick, used some race-based presumptions in favor of some minorities in determining which individuals were so disadvantaged. A highway construction company, which was managed by a white person, was not certified as such a small disadvantaged business. After the company allegedly lost a subcontract on a highway construction project to a certified competitor as a result of a subcontractor compensation clause in a contract awarded by a division of the United States Department of Transportation, the company (1) filed suit in the United States District Court for the District of Colorado against various federal officials; and (2) included a claim that the government's use of race-based presumptions with respect to subcontractor compensation clauses violated the equal protection component of the Fifth Amendment's due process clause. However, the District Court, in granting a motion by the officials for summary judgment, indicated that the controlling precedents were Fullilove v Klutznick and Metro Broadcasting v FCC, rather than Richmond v J. A. Croson Co. (790 F Supp 240). On appeal, the United States Court of Appeals for the Tenth Circuit, in affirming, upheld the use of subcontractor compensation clauses under what the court indicated was a lenient standard, ""resembling"" intermediate scrutiny, for review of federal affirmative action, that had been adopted in Fullilove v Klutznick and reaffirmed in Metro Broadcasting v FCC (16 F3d 1537).",lexis
"An inventor who owned a patent on a system which monitored and reported the status, location, and movement of clothing in dry-cleaning establishments, through the use of a keyboard and data processor and the generation of optically read bar codes, brought an action in the United States District Court for the Eastern District of Pennsylvania for patent infringement against defendants including the manufacturer of another system used in dry-cleaning establishments, which system also utilized a keyboard, a data processor, and bar codes. The inventor's patent claim stated that the product could ""maintain an inventory total"" and ""detect and localize spurious additions to inventory""; the defendants asserted that the manufacturer's system merely recorded an inventory of receivables by tracking invoices and transaction totals. A jury found that the manufacturer's system infringed upon the inventor's patent claim. The District Court, however, granted the defendants' deferred motion for judgment as a matter of law and directed a verdict in favor of the defendants, stating that (1) the term ""inventory"" in the patent claim encompassed both cash inventory and the actual physical inventory of articles of clothing, and (2) since the manufacturer's system was not capable of tracking articles of clothing and generating reports about their status and location, the system could not perform the functions described in the patent claim and thus did not infringe the inventor's patent (772 F Supp 1535). The inventor appealed, arguing that the District Court erred in substituting its construction of the word ""inventory"" for that presumably given the term by the jury.

The District Court dismissed the petition, but the Court of Appeals for the Fourth Circuit granted a certificate of probable cause and leave to appeal in forma pauperis. Shortly before the appeal was argued, the prisoner was paroled by the Virginia Parole Board under a parole order which placed him in the custody and control of the parole board, and directed him to live with his aunt and uncle in Georgia, required him to obtain his parole officer's permission to leave the community, change his residence, or own or operate a motor vehicle, and required him to make monthly reports to his parole officer, to permit the officer to visit his home or place of employment at any time, and to follow the officer's instructions and advice. When he was placed on parole, the prisoner moved to add the members of the Virginia Parole Board as respondents. The Court of Appeals refused to permit the parole board members to be added as respondents, on the ground that they did not have physical custody of the prisoner's person and therefore were not proper parties, and dismissed the petition for habeas corpus, holding that the case was moot as to the prison superintendent because he no longer had custody or control of the prisoner.

In accordance with a provision of the Act (40 USCS 484(k)(1)), which authorizes the Department to take into account ""any benefit which has accrued or may accrue to the United States"" from the transferee's use of the property, the appraised value of the tract was discounted by the Department's computation of a 100-percent public benefit allowance, which permitted the college to acquire the property without making any financial payment for it.

A New Jersey juvenile court admitted the evidence so discovered in delinquency proceedings against the student, holding that a school official may properly conduct a search of a student's person if the official has a reasonable suspicion that a crime has been or is in the process of being committed, or reasonable cause to believe that the search is necessary to maintain school discipline or enforce school policy, and that the search in this case was a reasonable one under this standard.

Following the cancellation of the franchise of one of the retailers, the finance company that handled the credit arrangements between the manufacturer and its retailers brought a diversity action in the United States District Court for the Northern District of California seeking recovery of money owed and of secured merchandise held by the retailer. In cross-claims the retailer alleged that the manufacturer violated 1 of the Sherman Act (15 USCS 1) by entering into franchise agreements that prohibited the sale of the manufacturer's products other than from specified locations. Relying on United States v Arnold, Schwinn & Co. (1976) 388 US 365, 18 L Ed 2d 1249, 87 S Ct 1856 (Schwinn), the District Court rejected the manufacturer's requested jury instruction that the location restriction was illegal only if it unreasonably restrained or suppressed competition, the court instead instructing that if the jury found that the manufacturer entered into a contract with its dealers pursuant to which the manufacturer exercised dominion or control over the products sold to the dealer, after having parted with title to the products, any effort thereafter to restrict locations from which dealers resold the merchandise would be illegal regardless of the reasonableness of the location restrictions. On appeal from a verdict and judgment rendered in favor of the retailer in the United States District Court for the Northern District of California, the United States Court of Appeals for the Ninth Circuit reversed, concluding that the manufacturer's location restriction had less potential for competitive harm than the restrictions invalidated in Schwinn and thus should be judged under the ""rule of reason"" rather than the per se rule stated in Schwinn (537 F2d 980).",lexis

"After the United States Government had obtained an arrest warrant based upon a complaint charging an alien who was a citizen and resident of Mexico with various narcotics-related offenses, Mexican police officers apprehended the alien and transported him to a border patrol station, where United States Marshals arrested him. United States Drug Enforcement Agency (DEA) agents, working in concert with Mexican police officers, then searched the alien's residences in Mexicali and San Felipe, Mexico, and seized certain documents, including, from the Mexicali residence, a tally sheet which the government believed reflected the quantities of marijuana smuggled by the alien into the United States. Subsequently, a Federal District Court granted the alien's motion to suppress evidence seized during the searches, on the grounds that (1) the Federal Constitution's Fourth Amendment applied to the searches, and (2) the DEA agents had failed to justify searching the alien's premises without a warrant. On interlocutory appeal, the United States Court of Appeals for the Ninth Circuit, affirming, expressed the view that (1) the protection of the Fourth Amendment extended to the government's search of the Mexicali residence; (2) since the DEA obtained no warrant to make that search, and since exigent circumstances were lacking, the search was unlawful under the Fourth Amendment; and (3) accordingly, the evidence obtained in that search had been properly suppressed (856 F2d 1214).",lexis

Thereupon the servicewoman instituted an action in the United States District Court for the Middle District of Alabama, contending that the statutes--which allow a serviceman to claim his wife as a dependent for such benefits without regard to whether she is in fact dependent upon him for any part of her support--unreasonably discriminated on the basis of sex in violation of the due process clause of the Fifth Amendment.

"After being taken into custody on a homicide charge, a defendant complained to a psychiatrist about hearing voices in his head and having trouble sleeping. The psychiatrist prescribed an antipsychotic drug, with which the defendant had been successfully treated in the past, and an antiepileptic drug. Following a determination by the District Court of Clark County, Nevada, that the defendant was competent to stand trial, the defense moved for an order suspending administration of both drugs until the end of the defendant's trial, on the grounds that (1) continued administration of these drugs infringed on his freedom; (2) the effect on his demeanor and mental state during trial would deny him due process; and (3) because he intended to offer an insanity defense at trial, he had a right to show jurors his true mental state. The District Court held an evidentiary hearing at which one psychiatrist testified that taking the defendant off the medication would not render him incompetent to stand trial or noticeably alter his behavior; another psychiatrist concurred as to competence and stated that the effects of the antipsychotic drug would not be noticeable to jurors if medication continued; a third psychiatrist expressed the view that the antipsychotic drug made the defendant calmer and more relaxed, that an excessive dose would cause drowsiness, and that the defendant's behavior if taken off the drug was unpredictable; and a fourth psychiatrist maintained that the defendant was incompetent to stand trial, and would likely regress into manifest psychosis and become very difficult to manage if taken off the antipsychotic drug. The District Court denied the motion to terminate medication in a one-page order which gave no indication of the court's rationale. At the close of a trial in which the defendant presented expert testimony about the effect of the antipsychotic drug on his demeanor, the jury found the defendant guilty of murder and robbery and sentenced him to death. In affirming the conviction and sentence, the Supreme Court of Nevada held that (1) the expert testimony at trial was sufficient to inform the jury of the effects of the antipsychotic drug on the defendant's demeanor and testimony; and (2) thus, while the defendant's demeanor was relevant to his insanity defense, the denial of his motion to terminate medication was neither an abuse of discretion nor a violation of the defendant's trial rights (808 P2d 535).",lexis

"Under 10(b) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 (Exchange Act), 15 USCS 78j(b), it is unlawful to use any deceptive device in connection with the purchase or sale of securities, in contravention of Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) rules, where SEC Rule 10b-5, 17 CFR 240.10b-5, prohibits employment of any device to defraud or deceive any person in connection with the purchase or sale of securities. Under 14(e) of the Exchange Act, 15 USCS 78n(e), fraudulent acts in connection with a tender offer are prohibited and definitional and prophylactic rule-making authority is delegated to the SEC, where SEC Rule 14-3(a), 17 CFR 240.14e-3(a), in creating a duty to either disclose material nonpublic information concerning an impending tender offer or abstain from trading in stocks implicated by the offer, proscribes trading on undisclosed information in the tender offer setting, even in the absence of a duty to disclose. When a law firm began representing a client regarding the client's confidential tender offer for a company's common stock, a firm partner, who did no work on the offer, purchased company stock and stock options that the partner sold at a profit of more than $ 4.3 million after the client publicly announced the tender offer and the stock price per share rose substantially. The partner, who was charged with defrauding the firm and the client by using for the partner's trading purposes material nonpublic information regarding the tender offer, was convicted in a Federal District Court of (1) 20 counts of mail fraud, in violation of 18 USCS 1341, (2) 17 counts of securities fraud, in violation of 10(b) and Rule 10b-5, (3) 17 counts of fraudulent trading in connection with a tender offer, in violation of 14(e) and Rule 14-3(a), and (4) 3 counts of money laundering, in violation of federal law. The United States Court of Appeals for the Eighth Circuit, reversing all of the partner's convictions, expressed the view that (1) liability under 10(b) and Rule 10b-5 could not be grounded on the misappropriation theory of securities fraud--the theory that a person committed fraud in connection with a securities transaction, and thereby violated 10(b) and Rule 10b-5, when the person misappropriated confidential information for securities trading purposes, in breach of a duty owed to the source of the information--on which the prosecution had relied; (2) Rule 14e-3(a) exceeded the SEC's 14(e) rule-making authority, because the rule contained no breach-of-fiduciary-duty requirement; and (3) the mail fraud and money laundering convictions could not stand, because they rested on violations of the securities laws (92 F.3d 612).",lexis

Although the committee proposed a resolution that the plaintiff be seated as a member of the 90th Congress, but be censured, fined, and deprived of his seniority, an amendment to the proposed resolution was offered calling for his exclusion from membership and a declaration that his seat was vacant. The Speaker of the House ruled that a majority vote of the House would be sufficient to pass the resolution if it were so amended. The amendment was adopted by a vote of 248 to 176, and the resolution excluding the plaintiff from membership and declaring his seat vacant was adopted by a vote of 307 to 116. The plaintiff and some of his constituents brought suit in the United States District Court for the District of Columbia, requesting injunctive and declaratory relief.

At issue was whether using a telephone to make a misdemeanor drug purchase facilitated felony drug distribution in violation of 21 U.S.C.S. _ 843(b). The Court presumed that when Congress enacted _ 843(b), it was familiar with the traditional judicial limitation on applying terms like ""aid,"" ""abet,"" and ""assist.""

Pursuant to the CDR program, most disability determinations were to be reviewed at least once every 3 years. Under the CDR program as originally instituted, a disability benefit claimant bore the burden, in an initial review conducted by a state agency, of demonstrating continued disability. If the claimant was found to be ineligible by the state agency, benefits were usually terminated at that point and were unavailable during review of the initial determination by a federal administrative law judge.

"The city of New York implemented a program--pursuant to Title I of the Elementary and Secondary Education Act of 1965 (20 USCS 6301 et seq.)--under which the city sent public school teachers into parochial schools during regular school hours to provide remedial education to disadvantaged children. The program's services were available to all children who met Title I's eligibility requirements, no matter what the students' religious beliefs or where the students went to school. In order to insure compliance with the city's rules against compromising the program's secular purpose, a publicly employed field supervisor was to attempt to make at least one unannounced visit to each teacher's classroom every month. In 1978, a number of federal taxpayers, seeking declaratory and injunctive relief, brought suit in the United States District Court for the Eastern District of New York against the city's board of education, in which suit it was claimed that the program violated the establishment of religion clause of the Federal Constitution's First Amendment. The District Court granted summary judgment for the board, but the United States Court of Appeals for the Second Circuit reversed (739 F2d 48). The United States Supreme Court, in affirming, held that the program created an excessive entanglement of church and state ( Aguilar v Felton (1985) 473 US 402, 87 L Ed 2d 290, 105 S Ct 3232). On remand, the District Court entered a permanent injunction barring the board from sending public school teachers into parochial schools to provide remedial education pursuant to Title I. The board subsequently provided Title I services to parochial school students at public school sites, at leased sites, and in vans parked near the parochial schools. The additional costs incurred as a result of implementing such systems were significant. In 1995, the board and a group of parents of parochial school students entitled to Title I services filed motions in the District Court to seek relief from the injunction under Rule 60(b)(5) of the Federal Rules of Civil Procedure, which authorizes a federal court to relieve a party from a final judgment or order when it is no longer equitable that the judgment should have prospective operation. The board and the parents contended, among other matters, that the law had changed since the Aguilar decision so as to make the program legal.

The record on remand showed that upon effecting a lawful, full custody arrest of the defendant for operating a motor vehicle after revocation of his operator's permit, a District of Columbia police officer, pursuant to established police department practice, had conducted a full field search of the defendant's person, seizing the heroin capsules, which were found in a crumpled cigarette package in the defendant's coat pocket.

The Supreme Court of Minnesota reversed, holding that Nebraska usury laws governed the operation of the Nebraska national bank's credit card program in Minnesota (262 NW2d 358).",lexis

"Petitioner inmate did not say that he wanted to remain silent or that he did not want to talk with the police. Had he made either of those simple, unambiguous statements, he would have invoked his right to cut off questioning. He did neither, so he did not invoke his right to remain silent. There was no basis to conclude that he did not understand his rights; and it followed that he chose not to invoke or rely on those rights when he did speak. His answer to a detective's question about whether the inmate prayed to God for forgiveness for shooting the victim was a course of conduct indicating waiver of the right to remain silent. If the inmate wanted to remain silent, he could have said nothing in response to the detective's questions, or he could have unambiguously invoked his Miranda rights and ended the interrogation. The fact that the inmate made the statement about three hours after receiving a Miranda warning did not overcome the fact that he engaged in a course of conduct indicating waiver. There was no evidence that the statement was coerced. It was not reasonably likely that a jury instruction would have made any difference in light of all the other evidence of guilt.",lexis

"A criminal defendant was acquitted of a criminal offense by reason of insanity under a District of Columbia statute requiring that he affirmatively establish his insanity by a preponderance of evidence. As required by statute, the acquittee was subsequently committed to a mental institution, and then at a hearing required to be held 50 days after his commitment, the District of Columbia Superior Court found that the acquittee was mentally ill and dangerous pursuant to a statute requiring that the acquittee establish by a preponderance of evidence that he is no longer mentally ill or dangerous. The acquittee was therefore returned to the mental institution, and a second release hearing was held after the acquittee had been hospitalized for more than one year, the maximum time he could have spent in prison if he had been convicted. Because his incarceration already exceeded the maximum period he could have spent in prison, the acquittee demanded at the hearing that he be released unconditionally or recommitted pursuant to the civil-commitment standards, which require for commitment proof by clear and convincing evidence of his mental illness and dangerousness, as opposed to the preponderance of the evidence standard that the acquittee was required to meet at the present hearing in order to be released. The Superior Court denied the acquittee's request for a civil-commitment hearing, reaffirmed the findings made at the 50-day hearing, and continued his commitment to the mental institution. The acquittee appealed to the District of Columbia Court of Appeals, and a panel of the court affirmed (396 A2d 183), but then granted a rehearing and reversed the Superior Court (411 A2d 624). Finally, the court heard the case en banc and affirmed the judgment of the Superior Court, rejecting the argument that the length of the prison sentence the acquittee might have received determines when he is entitled to release or civil-commitment (432 A2d 364).",lexis

After the state court denied relief, the inmate filed an action in federal district court, seeking an order requiring an Alaska district attorney's office to give him access to evidence that was introduced at his trial so he could have DNA tests conducted at his expense. The U.S. Supreme Court held that the court of appeals erred when it found that the inmate had a right under the Due Process Clause of the Fourteenth Amendment to have access to the evidence he sought. The issue of access to DNA evidence postconviction was best left to Congress and state legislatures, and there was nothing inadequate about the procedures Alaska provided to inmates.",lexis

The Internal Revenue Service, during the course of an investigation to determine the tax consequences of the payments, issued a summons pursuant to 26 USCS 7602 demanding production of, among other things, the questionnaires and the general counsel's notes on the interviews. The corporation declined to produce the material sought on the grounds that it was protected from disclosure by the attorney-client privilege and constituted the ""work product"" of an attorney prepared in anticipation of litigation. The United States sought enforcement of the summons in the United States District Court for the Western District of Michigan, which adopted a magistrate's conclusion that the summons should be enforced. On appeal, the United States Court of Appeals for the Sixth Circuit held that the attorney-client privilege did not apply to the extent the communications were made by officers and agents not responsible for directing the corporation's actions in response to legal advice, because the communications were not those of the ""client,"" and that the work-product doctrine did not apply to IRS summonses (600 F2d 1223).",lexis

The chancellor, in dismissing the suit, determined that (1) the statute was a content neutral and reasonable time, place, and manner restriction; (2) the 100-foot boundary served a compelling state interest in protecting voters from interference, harassment, and intimidation during the voting process; and (3) there was an alternative channel for the treasurer to exercise her free speech rights outside the 100-foot boundary. The Supreme Court of Tennessee, however, reversed, as it held that the statute violated the First Amendment, because (1) the statute was a content-based restriction on speech, in that the statute regulated a specific subject matter and a certain category of speakers; (2) such a content-based statute could not be upheld unless (a) the burden placed on free speech rights was justified by a compelling state interest, and (b) the means chosen bore a substantial relation to that interest and were the least intrusive means of achieving the goal; (3) the state had shown a compelling interest in banning such speech within the polling place itself, but not in regulating the premises around the polling place, so that the statute was not narrowly tailored; (4) other state statutes prohibiting voterintimidation or interference with elections provided a less restrictive alternative; and (5) a showing of a compelling interest in preventing congestion and disruption at the entrances to polling places might justify a shorter campaign-free radius (802 SW2d 210).",lexis

The plaintiff claimed that there was no conspiracy and that the defendant had suffered no damage, but the evidence showed the plaintiff's participation in an antitrust conspiracy, including participation in a Canadian patent pool with various other American companies against whom the government had brought a civil antitrust suit in 1958. The government suit was terminated as to all parties on November 1, 1962. The District Court, sitting without a jury, entered preliminary findings of fact and conclusions of law that the defendant had been damaged in stated amounts in all three foreign markets.

The District Court permitted the limitations and release defenses to be filed, and heard further evidence with respect to the British and Australian markets, as a result of which it reduced its damage award for those markets, but it refused to reopen the record for other purposes or to modify its findings or conclusions as to the Canadian market (239 F Supp 51).

Before the accused's trial in the United States District Court for the District of Montana, he moved for a restrictive evidentiary order. The accused offered to stipulate that (1) he had been convicted of a crime punishable by a term of imprisonment exceeding 1 year, and (2) the government had proven one of the essential elements of the 922(g)(1) offense.

The state supreme court did not decide the question whether it was bound under the Federal Constitution to give conclusive effect to an earlier federal court decision that the state criminal trespass statute was used, at the time when defendants went upon the golf course in question, to enforce a policy of racial discrimination by a state agency; the state supreme court held that, as a matter of state law, the findings and judgment of the federal court were not before it.

"In a school desegregation case brought by parents of Denver school children in the United States District Court for the District of Colorado, the District Court found that, for almost a decade, the Denver school board had engaged in an unconstitutional policy of deliberate racial segregation with respect to schools in the Park Hill area in northeast Denver; that the parents had failed to make a fresh showing of de jure segregation in other areas of the city, where the situation was ""more like de facto segregation""; and that the thus segregated core city schools were educationally inferior to the predominantly white schools in other parts of Denver. The court ordered desegregation of the Park Hill schools (303 F Supp 279, 303 F Supp 289) and implementation of a remedial plan, short of all-out desegregation but aimed at achieving ""substantial equality"" of educational opportunities, for the core city schools (313 F Supp 90).

"Under 8 USCS 1252(a)(1), an alien detained pending a deportation hearing generally may, in the discretion of the United States Attorney General, be (1) continued in custody; (2) released under a bond containing such conditions as the Attorney General may prescribe; or (3) released on conditional parole. The Western Region of the Immigration and Naturalization Service (INS)--which operated under the Attorney General--announced a policy allowing the release of alien minors to only a parent or lawful guardian, except in ""unusual and extraordinary"" cases. In 1985, several plaintiffs filed, in the United States District Court for the Central District of California, a suit which was eventually certified as a class action for a class of alien juveniles. The complaint raised claims challenging (1) the region's juvenile-release policy on constitutional, statutory, and international law grounds; and (2) the conditions of juveniles' detention. The District Court (1) granted the INS partial summary judgment on the statutory and international law release grounds; (2) approved a consent decree that settled all claims regarding detention conditions; and (3) granted the class partial summary judgment on an equal protection claim as to release. In 1988, the INS promulgated a regulation, codified as to deportation at 8 CFR 242.24, which (1) generally authorized the release of a detained alien juvenile, in order of preference, to a parent, a legal guardian, or specified close adult relatives of the juvenile, unless the INS determined that detention was required to secure an appearance or to insure the safety of the juvenile or others; (2) in limited circumstances, authorized discretionary consideration of the release of a juvenile to another person who executed an agreement to care for the juvenile and to insure the juvenile's attendance at future immigration proceedings; and (3) for unreleased juveniles, generally required a suitable placement at a facility which, in accordance with the consent decree, had to meet specified care standards. A week after the regulation took effect, however, the District Court, invalidating the regulatory scheme on due process grounds, (1) ordered the INS to release any otherwise eligible juvenile to a parent, guardian, custodian, conservator, or ""other responsible adult party""; (2) dispensed with the INS condition that an unrelated custodian agree to care for such a juvenile, as well as to insure the juvenile's attendance at future proceedings; and (3) revised the INS' review procedures by decreeing that an immigration judge hearing on probable cause and on release restrictions was to be provided ""forthwith"" after arrest, regardless of whether a juvenile requested it. On appeal, a panel of the United States Court of Appeals for the Ninth Circuit, in reversing, expressed the view that (1) the INS did not exceed its statutory authority in promulgating 242.24; (2) 242.24 did not violate substantive due process, under the Federal Constitution's Fifth Amendment; and (3) a remand was necessary with respect to a procedural due process claim (934 F2d 991). An 11-judge en banc court, designated pursuant to a Court of Appeals rule, then (1) cited federal constitutional grounds including due process; (2) vacated the panel opinion; and (3) affirmed the District Court's order in all respects (942 F2d 1352).",lexis

A Georgia grand jury indicted several white criminal defendants on charges of assault and battery against two alleged victims who were African-Americans. Before jury selection began, the prosecution moved to prohibit the defendants from exercising peremptory challenges in a racially discriminatory manner. The trial judge, however, in denying the motion, expressed the view that neither Georgia law nor federal law prohibited criminal defendants from exercising peremptory strikes in a racially discriminatory manner. On immediate appeal, the Supreme Court of Georgia, in affirming, (1) distinguished Edmonson v Leesville Concrete Co. as involving a civil action; and (2) declined, in view of what the court called the lon history of jury trials as an essential element of the protection of human rights, to diminish the free exercise of peremptory strikes by criminal defendants (261 Ga 473, 405 SE2d 688).

"An accused was charged with first-degree murder in a Florida indictment brought two years and one month after the alleged offense. The primary evidence against him was given by a witness who testified that the accused took him to a garbage dump in Seminole County, Florida, where the accused pointed out the remains of two women the accused claimed to have tortured and murdered. The witness testified that one victim's body was covered with blood and that there were cuts on the breasts, stomach, and chest, and that the accused recounted his torture of the victim while she was still living. At the close of the evidence, the trial court informed the accused that it would instruct the jury on the lesser included, noncapital offenses of attempted first-degree murder, second-degree murder, third-degree murder, and manslaughter, if the accused would waive the statute of limitations as to those offenses. The accused refused to waive the statute, and the court instructed the jury solely on capital murder. The jury returned a verdict of guilty of first-degree murder. At the sentencing hearing before the same jury, a majority of the jury recommended life imprisonment. The trial court nevertheless imposed a death sentence, the jury's sentencing recommendation being only advisory. The Supreme Court of Florida affirmed the conviction but reversed the death sentence because of the trial court's reliance on confidential information in the presentence investigation report without first disclosing the information to the accused and giving him an opportunity to present evidence in response (393 So 2d 1119). The United States Supreme Court denied certiorari (454 US 1037). On remand, after a new sentencing hearing at which the accused offered no evidence, the trial court sentenced the accused to death, relying on the accused's previous convictions of forcible carnal knowledge and aggravated battery to find the aggravating circumstance that the accused had previously been convicted of a felony involving the use of violence to the person, and reaffirming his conclusion that the crime was especially heinous, atrocious, and cruel.

The District Court granted the defendants' motion to dismiss the complaint on the ground that the action was barred by the Eleventh Amendment to the United States Constitution, and the United States Court of Appeals for the Ninth Circuit affirmed on grounds that the plaintiff had failed to allege an essential element of a claim under 504, namely, that a primary objective of the federal funds received by the defendants was to provide employment (677 F2d 1271).

"A defendant in a South Carolina capital murder trial, if convicted, was ineligible for parole under state law, as having been previously convicted of violent offenses. Prior to jury selection, the trial court, over defense counsel's objection, granted a prosecution motion for an order barring the defense from asking any voir dire question about parole. The defendant was convicted of murder and the trial's penalty phase began. Under South Carolina law, the only two sentencing alternatives available to the jury were death or life imprisonment. The prosecution argued that the defendant's future dangerousness was a sentencing factor for the jury to consider, an argument which the defendant sought to rebut. Defense counsel, concerned that the jury might not understand that a sentence of the defendant to life imprisonment did not carry with it the possibility of parole, asked the trial court to clarify this point. The trial court, however, initially (1) refused to give any instruction on parole eligibility; and (2) ordered defense counsel to refrain from saying anything to the jury about parole ineligibility. When the jury, after deliberating for about 90 minutes, sent a note asking whether the imposition of a life sentence carried with it the possibility of parole, the trial court responded with instructions to the effect that (1) the jury was not to consider parole or parole eligibility in reaching a verdict, and (2) the terms ""life imprisonment"" and ""death sentence"" were to be understood in their plain and ordinary meaning. The jury then returned with a sentence of death. On appeal, the defendant claimed that the trial court's refusal to provide the jury accurate information regarding his parole eligibility violated the cruel and unusual punishments clause of the Federal Constitution's Eighth Amendment and the due process clause of the Constitution's Fourteenth Amendment. The South Carolina Supreme Court, however, in upholding the death sentence, expressed the view that regardless of whether such a refusal might be error in some circumstances, the trial court's instructions in response to the jury's note satisfied in substance the defendant's request for a charge on parole eligibility (427 SE2d 175).",lexis

At hearings before a Board-appointed hearing officer, the evidence indicated that (1) a central administrative hierarchy served all of the university's schools, with ultimate authority vested in a Board of Trustees (2) university-wide policies were formulated by the central administration, with the Board of Trustees' approval, (3) individual schools within the university were substantially autonomous, and (4) the faculty at each school effectively determined the curriculum, grading system, admission and matriculation standards, academic calendars, and course schedules, and, furthermore, made recommendations, which were generally implemented, in every case of faculty hiring, tenure, sabbaticals, termination and promotion. Concluding that the faculty were professional employees entitled to the protection of the National Labor Relations Act (29 USCS 152(12)), the Board granted the union's petition and ordered an election (221 NLRB 1053). After the union won the election and was certified by the Board, the university refused to bargain.

The defendant, who emerged from the hair dryer with black curly hair, was taken into custody by the detectives as a suspect in the shooting. In response to questioning by the detectives, the defendant stated that on the previous day his hair had been reddish-brown, long, and combed straight back, and that he had gone to the beauty parlor to have his hair dyed black and curled in order to change his appearance. After the defendant was indicted by the state of Illinois on one count of murder and one count of attempted murder, and prior to his trial in the Circuit Court of Cook County, Illinois, the defendant moved to suppress the statements which he had made to the detectives regarding his hair, on the ground that such statements had been obtained in violation of the Federal Constitution's Fourth Amendment, since the detectives had lacked probable cause for their warrantless arrest of the defendant. The Circuit Court sustained the motion to suppress, and ruled that the statements were inadmissible. At trial, several boys from the group into which the shots had been fired made in-court identifications of the defendant--who at trial had black hair worn in a ""natural"" style--as the person responsible for the shooting, while each boy also testified that the person responsible for the shooting had had long, reddish, and slicked-back hair, and that the defendant had been seen several weeks before the shooting wearing his hair in such a style. The defendant did not testify in his defense, but a friend of his family was called as a defense witness, and testified that the defendant had had black hair on the day of the shooting. Over the defendant's objection, the state then sought to introduce the statements which the defendant had made to the detectives regarding his hair, for the purpose of impeaching the witness' testimony.

"The Santeria religion, a fusion of traditional African religion with elements of Roman Catholicism, practices animal sacrifice as a principal form of devotion. The primary purpose of such sacrifices, which occur during various rituals or ceremonies, is to make an offering to spirits, but the sacrificed animals are cooked and eaten except after certain rituals. In April 1987, a church practicing Santeria announced plans to open a house of worship in Hialeah, Florida. This announcement prompted the Hialeah city council to hold an emergency public meeting on June 9, 1987, at which meeting the council (1) adopted a resolution noting the concern expressed by city residents that ""certain religions"" might propose to engage in practices inconsistent with public morals, peace, or safety; and (2) approved an ordinance incorporating Florida's animal cruelty laws, which, among other things, subjected to criminal punishment whoever unnecessarily or cruelly killed any animal. At the council's request, the attorney general of Florida issued an opinion expressing the view that religious animal sacrifice was not a ""necessary"" killing and so was prohibited by state law. In September 1987, the council adopted (1) an ordinance (a) prohibiting the possession, sacrifice, or slaughter of an animal with the intent to use such animal for food purposes, which prohibition applied if the animal was killed in any type of ritual regardless of whether the animal was in fact consumed, and (b) containing an exemption for a killing for food, occurring during the course of a ritual, where such killing occurred in a properly zoned and licensed establishment and involved animals specifically raised for food purposes; (2) an ordinance prohibiting the sacrifice of animals, and defining sacrifice as the unnecessary killing of an animal in a public or private ritual or ceremony not for the primary purpose of food consumption; and (3) an ordinance (a) prohibiting the slaughter of animals outside of areas zoned for slaughterhouses, but (b) exempting any person, group, or organization that slaughtered or processed for sale small numbers of hogs or cattle per week in accordance with an exemption provided by state law. Claiming, among other things, that the city had violated the church's rights under the free exercise of religion clause of the Federal Constitution's First Amendment, the church and its president filed an action for declaratory, injunctive, and monetary relief in the United States District Court for the Southern District of Florida. After a bench trial, the District Court ruled for the city on the free exercise claim, expressing the view that (1) although the ordinances were not religiously neutral, their effect on the church's religious conduct was incidental to the ordinances' secular purpose and effect; (2) the ordinances were justified by the city's compelling interests in preventing health risks, preventing emotional injury to children, protecting animals from cruel and unnecessary killing, and restricting the slaughter of animals to areas zoned for slaughterhouse use; and (3) any more narrow restrictions would be unenforceable because of the secret nature of the Santeria religion (723 F Supp 1467).

"The representative of an employer conducted an investigatory interview with one of the employer's workers regarding the employee's suspected theft of food from the employer. During the interview the employee requested that the union shop steward or some other union representative be called to the interview, but her several requests for such representation were denied. An unfair labor practice proceeding was brought, and the National Labor Relations Board held that the employer's denial of the employee's request for union representation at the interview, which interview the employee reasonably believed might result in disciplinary action, constituted an unfair labor practice under 8(a)(1) of the National Labor Relations Act (29 USCS 158(a)(1)) since the denial of representation at the interview interfered with, restrained, and coerced the individual right of employees, protected by 7 of the Act (29 USCS 157), to engage in concerted activities for mutual aid or protection (202 NLRB 446). The United States Court of Appeals for the Fifth Circuit, holding that the Board's present construction of 7 of the Act, contrary to its prior construction, was impermissible, refused to enforce the Board's order which directed that the employer cease and desist from requiring an employee to take part in an investigatory interview without union representation if the employee requested representation and reasonably feared disciplinary action (485 F2d 1135).",lexis
"In order to control subsidence damage caused by mining operations, a Pennsylvania statute and implementing regulations required coal mine operators (1) to leave a certain amount of coal in the ground for support under certain surface structures, including publicly used buildings, cemeteries, and perennial streams, and (2) to repair or pay for the repair of subsidence damage to such structures, on pain of losing their mining permits, even if the surface owners or their predecessors had waived any claim to such damages. Individual coal companies and an industry association filed an action in the United States District Court for the Western District of Pennsylvania in which they claimed that the statute was invalid on its face and sought to enjoin its enforcement, on the grounds that these provisions (1) constituted an impairment of contract obligations, in violation of the contract clause of the Federal Constitution (Art I, 10, cl 1), by not allowing mine operators to enforce the damage waivers, and (2) constituted a ""taking"" of property without just compensation, in violation of the Fifth Amendment, because they deprived the mine operators of the ""support estate"" which state law recognized as a property interest separate from surface and mineral rights. The District Court granted summary judgment in favor of the defendant state officials, as it held that the statute (1) did not violate the contract clause, though it did impair contractual relations, because it was reasonably related to a legitimate public purpose, and (2) did not effect a ""taking"" within the meaning of the takings clause because it did not destroy the entire bundle of rights in the ""support estate"" and, unlike the similar statute invalidated in Pennsylvania Coal Co. v Mahon (1922) 260 US 393, 67 L Ed 322, 43 S Ct 158, 28 ALR 1321, had the expressed purpose of protecting public health and safety (581 F Supp 511). In affirming that judgment, the United States Court of Appeals for the Third Circuit (1) agreed that the Pennsylvania Coal case was not controlling, and (2) ruled that the ""support estate"" was only part of a broader bundle of rights which invariably included either surface or mineral rights and which had not been entirely taken (771 F2d 707).",lexis

The actions were filed within the 3-year FELA time limit provided under 45 USCS 56, but not within the 1-year limit specified in the states' statutory consent to sue the Port Authority. The District Court (1) expressed the view that the railroad (a) was entitled the immunity from suit in federal court enjoyed by the states of New York and New Jersey under the Constitution's Eleventh Amendment, and (b) could be sued in federal court only within the 1-year time frame allowed by those states; and (2) dismissed both actions (809 F Supp 1172 and 813 F Supp 1095).

Two defendants were arrested after being indicted on numerous counts of racketeering activity--including fraud, extortion, gambling, and conspiracy to commit murder--as well as other federal crimes. At a hearing pursuant to the Bail Reform Act in the United States District Court for the Southern District of New York, the Federal Government presented evidence--contested by the defendants--that (1) the defendants were a ""boss"" and a ""captain,"" respectively, in an organized crime ""family""; (2) both defendants had participated in conspiracies to aid their illegitimate enterprises through violent means; and (3) one defendant had personally participated in two murder conspiracies. The District Court (1) granted the government's motion for pretrial detention under the Act on the grounds of dangerousness, and (2) expressed the view that the evidence of the two defendants' present danger to the community was overwhelming (631 F Supp 1364). On appeal, the United States Court of Appeals for the Second Circuit ruled that the District Court's pretrial detention order ought to be vacated, expressing the view that (1) pretrial detention of the two defendants on the ground of dangerousness met the Act's statutory conditions; but (2) the Bail Reform Act's authorization of pretrial detention on the ground of dangerousness to the community was repugnant to the Federal Constitution's concept of substantive due process, which concept, the Court of Appeals reasoned, prohibited a total deprivation of liberty simply as a means of preventing future crimes (794 F2d 64).",lexis
"An individual was charged with killing a person in the course of a burglary. The accused initially was found incompetent by a pretrial judge in an Oklahoma state trial court and committed to a state mental health facility for treatment, but after being released some 3 months later, the accused was found competent to stand trial by a trial judge despite conflicting expert testimony. The trial judge again found the accused to be competent at a subsequent pretrial hearing despite being advised by the accused's counsel that the accused was behaving oddly and was refusing to communicate with him. On the first day of trial, the accused's bizarre behavior prompted the court to conduct another competency hearing, during which (1) evidence was presented that the accused (a) feared that his defense attorney was trying to kill him, and (b) was trying to keep as far away from his attorney as possible, and (2) a psychologist testified that the accused was presently incompetent and unable to communicate effectively with counsel. Ruling against the accused, the trial judge stated that the accused had not carried the burden of showing clear and convincing evidence of his incompetency. The accused did not communicate with or sit near his defense counsel during the trial, and through much of the proceedings, the accused remained in prison overalls, crouching in the fetal position and talking to himself. The accused's counsel moved for a mistrial or a renewed competency investigation. The court summarily denied the motions, and the accused was convicted of first-degree murder and sentenced to death. On appeal, the Oklahoma Court of Criminal Appeals, affirming, rejected the accused's contention that Oklahoma's presumption of competence, combined with the requirement of an Oklahoma statute that a criminal defendant establish incompetence by clear and convincing evidence, placed such an onerous burden on the accused as to violate the accused's right to due process of law under the Federal Constitution's Fourteenth Amendment (889 P2d 293).",lexis

"A defendant was tried in the United States District Court for the District of New Mexico for the felony charge of sexual abuse of a child, his daughter, who was age 4 at the time of the alleged crime, which allegedly occurred on an Indian reservation. The defendant and the child's mother were divorced, and, while the defendant had primary physical custody of the daughter, the mother was awarded custody for the summer of 1990. The prosecution's theory was that the defendant committed assaults upon his daughter while she was in his custody and that the crime was disclosed when the child was spending vacation time with her mother. The defense argued that the allegations were concocted so that the child would not be returned to her father. At the time of trial the child was 6 1/2 years old. After she testified and was cross-examined, the prosecution produced six witnesses who testified as to statements that the child had made describing the sexual assaults. The first of those statements was allegedly made on August 22, 1990, to a babysitter, the mother reported the alleged offense on August 27, two witnesses testified to a statement made on August 27, and other witnesses testified to statements made at later times. The District Court admitted all of the statements under Rule 801(d)(1)(B) of the Federal Rules of Evidence--which describes statements which are not hearsay--on the basis that the statements rebutted the implicit charge that the child's testimony was motivated by a desire to live with her mother. The defendant was convicted, and, on appeal, the United States Court of Appeals for the Tenth Circuit affirmed, expressing the view that (1) the child's out-of-court statements were admissible under Rule 801(d)(1)(B) even though they had been made after the child's alleged motive to fabricate arose; (2) while some courts required a declarant's prior consistent statements to have been made before the alleged motive or influence arose, the premotive requirement was a function of the relevancy rules, not the hearsay rules; and (3) under a Rule 801(d)(1)(B) balancing approach which weighed the probative value of particular statements against their prejudicial effect, the district judge had not abused his discretion in admitting the child's out-of-court statements (3 F3d 342).",lexis

Thereafter, the accomplice struggled with the storekeeper, the storekeeper's mother was fatally stabbed by the accomplice while the mother was trying to help her son, and the accomplice was shot to death by the storekeeper. At his murder trial in a South Carolina court, the accused testified that he had brought a weapon to the store only to intimidate the storekeeper, and that neither he nor his accomplice had intended to kill anyone during the robbery; but the prosecutor argued that the accused and his accomplice had intended to kill any witnesses, and the jury--having been instructed that malice may be implied or presumed from (1) the willful, deliberate, and intentional doing of an unlawful act without just cause or excuse, or (2) the use of a deadly weapon--found the accused guilty of murder.

Counsel for the accused neither objected to the statement nor requested a cautionary instruction, but the court nevertheless admonished the jury that it could draw no inference whatsoever from the accused's election not to testify. On appeal of the convictions, the United States Court of Appeals for the Sixth Circuit reversed, holding that the prosecutor's comment (1) violated the privilege against compulsory self-incrimination under the Fifth Amendment to the Federal Constitution, and (2) constituted plain error, rendering the convictions reversible notwithstanding the failure of the accused's counsel to timely object (794 F2d 1132).",lexis

"After a fireman employed by a railroad suffered fatal injuries in a collision allegedly caused by the railroad's negligence, the administratrix of the fireman's estate brought suit in the Circuit Court of Cook County, Illinois, under the Federal Employers' Liability Act (45 USCS 51 et seq.) to recover the damages that his survivors suffered as a result of his death. A jury in the Circuit Court awarded the administratrix $ 775,000 after a full trial. On appeal, the Appellate Court of Illinois, First District, held that it was not error for the trial judge to have refused to instruct the jury that ""your award will not be subject to any income taxes, and you should not consider such taxes in fixing the amount of your award,"" and also that the trial judge had not erred in excluding evidence of the effect of income taxes on future earnings of the decedent (62 Ill App 3d 653, 378 NE2d 1232).

"Under 26 USCS 6321 and 6322, a federal tax lien arises at the time that a taxpayer is assessed for unpaid federal taxes due. Such lien is upon all real and personal property belonging to a taxpayer, including after-acquired property. However, under 26 USCS 6323(a), such lien is not valid against a judgment lien creditor until notice of the lien has been filed. In December 1986, the Federal Government assessed two taxpayers, a husband and wife, for unpaid federal taxes. In July 1987, a bank docketed in Salt Lake County, Utah a state court judgment that the bank had won against the taxpayers. Under Utah law, such docketing created a judgment lien on all of the taxpayers' then-owned, and after-acquired, real property in the county. On September 9, 1987, the Federal Government filed notice of its tax lien in Salt Lake County. On September 23, 1987, the taxpayers acquired title to certain real property in Salt Lake County. To facilitate later sale of the property, an escrow agreement was entered in which the Federal Government and the bank released their claims to the property, but reserved their rights to the cash proceeds of the sale based on priorities in the property as of September 23, 1987. Pursuant to the escrow agreement, the taxpayers instituted an interpleader action in a Utah state court in order to determine which lien was entitled to priority. The Federal Government removed the action to the United States District Court for the District of Utah. On cross motions for summary judgment, the District Court awarded priority to the bank's judgment lien. On appeal, the United States Court of Appeals for the Tenth Circuit, in affirming, expressed the view that judgment lien creditors who perfected their liens before the filing of a federal tax lien had priority, regardless of whether after-acquired property was involved (945 F2d 1475).",lexis
"The Securities Investor Protection Corporation (SIPC) brought suit in the United States District Court for the Central District of California against a person who was alleged to be one of several conspirators in a stock manipulation scheme that disabled two broker-dealers from meeting obligations to customers. It was alleged that the scheme had triggered SIPC's authority, pursuant to a provision of the Securities Investor Protection Act (SIPA) (15 USCS 78fff-3(b)(2)), to advance funds to the broker-dealers' trustees in order to reimburse the customers. SIPC claimed that the alleged conspirators had violated 10(b) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 (15 USCS 78j(b)), the Securities and Exchange Commission's Rule 10b-5 ( 17 CFR 240.10b-5), and various provisions of the Racketeer Influenced and Corrupt Organizations Act (RICO) (18 USCS 1961-1968), and that SIPC was thus entitled to recover treble damages under a provision of RICO (18 USCS 1964(c)). The District Court, entering summary judgment for the defendant on the RICO claims, held that (1) SIPC did not meet the purchaser-seller requirements for standing to assert RICO claims that were predicated on 10(b) and Rule 10b-5, given that SIPC was not a purchaser or seller of securities, and (2) SIPC had not shown that the defendant's alleged acts were the proximate cause of SIPC's losses. On appeal, the United States Court of Appeals for the Ninth Circuit reversed and remanded on the grounds that (1) the RICO cause of action under 1964(c) does not impose a purchaser-seller requirement for standing, and (2) the District Court had erred in finding no proximate cause (908 F2d 1461).",lexis

Pending determination of the action, the railroads withdrew their application on which the order had been issued.

He was then returned to the California prison, and a detainer requesting his return to North Carolina at the termination of his California imprisonment, so that he could serve the North Carolina sentence, was received and acknowledged by his California warden. In the United States District Court for the Northern District of California, the prisoner petitioned for habeas corpus, challenging on federal constitutional grounds the validity of his North Carolina conviction. The District Court denied the petition, holding that habeas corpus relief with respect to the North Carolina conviction was foreclosed while the prisoner was still in custody under the prior California judgment. Subsequently, the prisoner petitioned the District Court for a rehearing, contending that the detainer was a form of custody which affected his California custodial classification and probability of parole, but the District Court denied a rehearing. The Court of Appeals for the Ninth Circuit reversed, holding that (1) although the two sentences were imposed by different sovereigns, the prisoner could maintain federal habeas corpus proceedings attacking the validity of the second sentence without awaiting completion of the service of the first sentence, and (2) since the prisoner was in state custody in the Northern District of California, the District Court had jurisdiction to entertain the habeas corpus application (410 F2d 1179).",lexis

"Chapter 13 of the Bankruptcy Code uses a statutory formula known as the ‚Äúmeans test‚Äù to help ensure that debtors who can pay creditors do pay them. The means test instructs a debtor to determine his ‚Äúdisposable income‚Äù‚Äîthe amount he has available to reimburse creditors‚Äîby deducting from his current monthly income ‚Äúamounts reasonably necessary to be expended‚Äù for, inter alia, ‚Äúmaintenance or support.‚Äù 11 U. S. C. ¬ß1325(b)(2)(A)(i). For a debtor whose income is above the median for his State, the means test indentifies which expenses qualify as ‚Äúamounts reasonably necessary to be expended.‚Äù As relevant here, the statute provides that ‚Äú[t]he debtor‚Äôs monthly expenses shall be the debtor‚Äôs applicable monthly expense amounts specified under the National Standards and Local Standards, and the debtor‚Äôs actual monthly expenses for the categories specified as Other Necessary Expenses issued by the Internal Revenue Service [IRS] for the area in which the debtor resides.‚Äù ¬ß707(b)(2)(A)(ii)(I). The Standards are tables listing standardized expense amounts for basic necessities, which the IRS prepares to help calculate taxpayers‚Äô ability to pay overdue taxes. The IRS also creates supplemental guidelines known as the ‚ÄúCollection Financial Standards,‚Äù which describe how to use the tables and what the amounts listed in them mean. The Local Standards include an allowance for transportation expenses, divided into vehicle ‚ÄúOwnership Costs‚Äù and vehicle ‚ÄúOperating Costs.‚Äù The Collection Financial Standards explain that ‚ÄúOwnership Costs‚Äù cover monthly loan or lease payments on an automobile; the expense amounts listed are based on nationwide car financing data. The Collection Financial Standards further state that a taxpayer who has no car payment may not claim an allowance for ownership costs. When petitioner Ransom filed for Chapter 13 bankruptcy relief, he listed respondent (FIA) as an unsecured creditor. Among his assets, Ransom reported a car that he owns free of any debt. In determining his monthly expenses, he nonetheless claimed a car-ownership deduction of $471, the full amount specified in the ‚ÄúOwnership Costs‚Äù table, as well as a separate $388 deduction for car-operating costs. Based on his means-test calculations, Ransom proposed a bankruptcy plan that would result in repayment of approximately 25% of his unsecured debt. FIA objected on the ground that the plan did not direct all of Ransom‚Äôs disposable income to unsecured creditors. FIA contended that Ransom should not have claimed the car-ownership allowance because he does not make loan or lease payments on his car.

"In 1978, Congress enacted the Inspector General Act (IGA) (5 USCS Appx 1 et seq.), which created an Office of Inspector General (OIG) in each of several federal agencies, including the National Aeronautics and Space Administration (NASA). On the next day, Congress enacted a Federal Service Labor-Management Relations Statute (FSLMRS) provision (5 USCS 7114(a)(2)(B)) which gives an employee of a unionized unit in an agency a right to union representation at any examination of the employee by a ""representative of the agency"" in connection with an investigation, if the employee (1) reasonably believes that an examination may result in disciplinary action against the employee, and (2) requests representation. During an investigation by NASA's OIG of some allegedly threatening activities by an employee at a NASA facility in Alabama, an OIG investigator agreed that a union representative could attend an interview of the employee, but the investigator's conduct of the interview gave rise to a complaint by the union representative that the investigator had improperly limited the representative's participation. The union filed with the Federal Labor Relations Authority (FLRA) a charge alleging that NASA and its OIG had committed an unfair labor practice. An Administrative Law Judge, in ruling for the union, concluded that (1) the OIG investigator was a representative of the agency within the meaning of 7114(a)(2)(B), and (2) certain aspects of the investigator's behavior had violated the right to union representation under 7114(a)(2)(B). On review, the FLRA (1) agreed that the investigator (a) was a representative of the agency for such purposes, and (b) had improperly prevented the union representative from actively participating in the interview; and (2) issued an enforcement order (50 FLRA 601). The United States Court of Appeals for the Eleventh Circuit, in denying a NASA petition for review and in granting an application by the FLRA for enforcement of its order, expressed the view that the FLRA had correctly concluded that the investigator was a representative of the agency within the meaning of 7114(a)(2)(B) (120 F3d 1208, 1997 US App LEXIS 22959).",lexis

Between 1961 and 1977, the successive Governors of North Dakota consented to the acquisition of easements covering approximately 1.5 million acres of wetlands in that state and the United States obtained easements covering about one-half of this acreage. In 1977, North Dakota enacted legislation which restricted the United States' ability to acquire easements over wetlands by requiring the Governor to submit proposed wetland easement acquisitions to the county commissioners of the county in which the land was located, by requiring detailed impact analyses by the federal agency involved and the county involved, both analyses being at federal expense, and by requiring the Governor to refuse to approve the acquisition if the county involved did not recommend the acquisition. Further, the North Dakota statutes authorized the landowner involved to negotiate the terms of the sale and the time period of the easement, with a maximum time period of 99 years, and to restrict the easement by legal description to the lands sought and to drain any after-expanded wetland or water area in excess of the legal description.

The Government tried all three defendants jointly in the Southern District of New York. Prior to trial, the Government moved to admit Stillwell‚Äôs postarrest confession in which he admitted that he had been in the van in which Lee was killed, but he claimed that Samia had shot Lee. Since Stillwell would not be testifying on his own behalf and the full confession implicated Samia, the Government proposed that the confession be introduced through the testimony of a DEA agent, who would testify to the content of Stillwell‚Äôs confession in a way that eliminated Samia‚Äôs name while avoiding any obvious indications of redaction. The District Court granted the Government‚Äôs motion with additional alterations to conform to its understanding of this Court‚Äôs Confrontation Clause precedents. At trial, the Government‚Äôs theory of the case was that Hunter had hired Samia and Stillwell to pose as real-estate buyers and visit properties with Lee and that Samia, Stillwell, and Lee were in a van driven by Stillwell when Samia shot Lee.

In 2010, shortly before trial, the Government informed the parties that an earlier-filed qui tam suit (Thorpe) had similar claims, leading the District Court to dismiss Carter I without prejudice under the first-to-file bar.

On appeal by the government, the Court of Appeals for the Second Circuit held that the District Court's opinion interpreting the regulation was tantamount to a construction of the statute upon which the information was founded; and that, hence, under the Criminal Appeals Act (18 USC 3731), the order of dismissal was appealable directly to the Supreme Court of the United States.

"After a series of investigations by the Department of Labor's Employment Standards Administration (ESA), a restaurant management corporation was charged with numerous violations of the child labor provisions of the Fair Labor Standards Act (29 USCS 212). An ESA assistant regional administrator assessed a total fine of $ 103,000 in civil penalties for the various violations, a figure which included a large supplemental assessment attributable to his conclusion that the violations were willful. Following a hearing, an administrative law judge accepted the assistant regional administrator's contention that violations had occurred, but determined that the violations were not willful, and reduced the total assessment accordingly. The corporation did not seek judicial review of the administrative law judge's decision, but rather brought suit in the United States District Court for the District of Columbia, contending that 16(e) of the Fair Labor Standards Act (29 USCS 216(e)), under which sums collected as civil penalties for the unlawful employment of child labor are returned to the ESA in reimbursement for the costs of determining violations and assessing penalties, violated the due process clause of the Fifth Amendment. The corporation argued that 16(e) created an impermissible risk and appearance of bias by encouraging the assistant regional administrator to make unduly numerous and large civil penalty assessments. Granting summary judgment for the corporation, the District Court found that because an ESA regional office's greater effort in uncovering violations could lead to an increased amount of penalties and a greater share of reimbursements for that office, 16(e) could distort an assistant regional administrator's objectivity in assessing penalties for violations of the child labor provisions.",lexis

S. 1, _, this Court held that ""a procedural default will not bar a federal habeas court from hearing a substantial claim of ineffective assistance at trial if, in the [State's] initial-review collateral proceeding, there was no counsel or counsel in that proceeding was ineffective."" Martinez regarded a prisoner from Arizona, where state procedural law required the prisoner to raise the claim during his first state collateral review proceeding. Ibid. This case regards a prisoner from Texas, where state procedural law does not require a defendant to raise his ineffective-assistance-of-trial-counsel claim on collateral review. Rather, Texas law appears to permit a prisoner to raise such a claim on direct review, but the structure and design of the Texas system make it virtually impossible for a prisoner to do so. The question presented in this case is whether, despite this difference, the rule set out in Martinez applies in Texas. Petitioner Trevino was convicted of capital murder in Texas state court and sentenced to death after the jury found insufficient mitigating circumstances to warrant a life sentence. Neither new counsel appointed for his direct appeal nor new counsel appointed for state collateral review raised the claim that Trevino's trial counsel provided ineffective assistance during the penalty phase by failing to adequately investigate and present mitigating circumstances. When that claim was finally raised in Trevino's federal habeas petition, the District Court stayed the proceedings so Trevino could raise it in state court. The state court found the claim procedurally defaulted because of Trevino's failure to raise it in his initial state postconviction proceedings, and the federal court then concluded that this failure was an independent and adequate state ground barring the federal courts from considering the claim. The Fifth Circuit affirmed. Its decision predated Martinez, but that court has since concluded that Martinez does not apply in Texas because Martinez's good-cause exception applies only where state law says that a defendant must initially raise his ineffective-assistance-of-trial-counsel claim in initial state collateral review proceedings, while Texas law appears to permit a defendant to raise that claim on direct appeal.",lexis

"Petitioners-Timothy Catlett, Russell Overton, Levy Rouse, Kelvin Smith, Charles and Christopher Turner, and Clifton Yarboroughand several others were indicted for the kidnaping, robbery, and murder of Catherine Fuller. At trial, the Government advanced the theory that Fuller was attacked by a large group of individuals. Its evidentiary centerpiece consisted of the testimony of Calvin Alston and Harry Bennett, who confessed to participating in a group attack and cooperated with the Government in return for leniency. Several other Government witnesses corroborated aspects of Alston's and Bennett's testimony. Melvin Montgomery testified that he was in a park among a group of people, heard someone say they were ""going to get that one,"" saw petitioner Overton pointing to Fuller, and saw several persons, including some petitioners, cross the street in her direction. Maurice Thomas testified that he saw the attack, identified some petitioners as participants, and later overheard petitioner Catlett say that they ""had to kill her."" Carrie Eleby and Linda Jacobs testified that they heard screams coming from an alley where a ""gang of boys"" was beating someone near a garage, approached the group, and saw some petitioners participating in the attack. Finally, the Government played a videotape of petitioner Yarborough's statement to detectives, describing how he was part of a large group that carried out the attack. None of the defendants rebutted the prosecution witnesses' claims that Fuller was killed in a group attack. The seven petitioners were convicted. Long after their convictions became final, petitioners discovered that the Government had withheld evidence from the defense at the time of trial. In postconviction proceedings, they argued that seven specific pieces of withheld evidence were both favorable to the defense and material to their guilt under Brady v. Maryland, 373 U. S. 83. This evidence included the identity of a man seen running into the alley after the murder and stopping near the garage where Fuller's body had already been found; the statement of a passerby who claimed to hear groans coming from a closed garage; and evidence tending to impeach witnesses Eleby, Jacobs, and Thomas. The D. C. Superior Court rejected petitioners' Brady claims, finding that the withheld evidence was not material. The D. C. Court of Appeals affirmed.",lexis

"A provision of the Airport and Airway Improvement Act of 1982 (49 USCS Appx 1513(d)(1)) forbids a state or its subdivisions to levy or collect an ad valorem property tax on air carrier transportation property at a rate that exceeds the rate applicable to commercial and industrial property in the same assessment jurisdiction. However, 49 USCS Appx 1513(d)(3) provides that this prohibition does not apply to an ""in lieu tax which is wholly utilized for airport and aeronautical purposes."" Four airline companies operating in South Dakota challenged that state's flight property tax, alleging that the tax violated the Act because most other personal property was not taxed. The proceeds of the South Dakota tax, which is imposed on a portion of the value of certain aircraft, are allocated by statute to the airports regularly used by the airlines, and the tax is applied to the exclusion of any other tax on the airlines' property. The four airlines unsuccessfully sued the appropriate county commissions for a refund of taxes paid after the effective date of the Act. The airlines also appealed their property tax assessment to South Dakota's State Board of Equalization, which denied the appeal. All of these lawsuits were consolidated in the Circuit Court for the Sixth Judicial District in Hughes County, South Dakota, which held that the flight property tax was permitted under 49 USCS Appx 1513(d)(3). On appeal, the Supreme Court of South Dakota expressed disagreement with the conclusion that the tax was authorized under 1513(d)(3) as an ""in lieu tax,"" but it affirmed on an alternate ground (372 NW2d 106).",lexis

Several decades later, over 1,000 individual allottees of land on the Quinault Reservation, the Quinault Tribe, which itself held some allotments, and an unincorporated association, which had been formed to promote the interests of the Quinault Reservation allottees, brought actions against the United States in the United States Court of Claims, seeking to recover money damages from the federal government for its alleged mismanagement of timber resources on the allotted lands in breach of a fiduciary duty owed to allottees by the United States under the General Allotment Act. Denying the United States' motion to dismiss the Consolidated actions on the asserted ground that the federal government had not waived its sovereign immunity with respect to the claims raised, the Court of Claims ruled that government mismanagement of the kind alleged in the action breaches the federal government's fiduciary duty under the General Allotment Act, and that the Act provides Indian allottees with a cause of action for money damages against the United States for breaches of such duty (219 Ct Cl ____, 591 F2d 1300).",lexis

"In these two, consolidated cases, the major questions presented were whether a writ of habeas corpus ad prosequendum, issued by a Federal District Court to state prison authorities to secure the presence of a state prisoner in the federal court to stand trial on federal criminal charges, constituted either a ""detainer"" or a ""written request for temporary custody"" within the meaning of the Interstate Agreement on Detainers (see 18 USCS App)--which prescribes procedures by which a member state (including the United States) may obtain for trial a prisoner incarcerated in another member jurisdiction by filing a ""detainer"" and a ""request"" for temporary custody. In the first case (No. 76-1596), the United States District Court for the Eastern District of New York issued writs of habeas corpus ad prosequendum to New York prison authorities to secure the presence of two state prisoners for arraignment on federal criminal charges. After the prisoners pleaded not guilty, and after their trial dates were set, the District Court, because of overcrowded federal facilities, directed that the prisoners be returned to their respective state prisons to await their federal trials. Subsequently, the District Court granted the prisoners' motions to dismiss the indictments, holding that the Agreement governed their removal from state custody by means of the writs of habeas corpus ad prosequendum, and that the government had violated the Agreement's requirement that a prisoner must be tried in the receiving state before being returned to the sending state (414 F Supp 358). The United States Court of Appeals for the Second Circuit affirmed, holding that a writ of habeas corpus ad prosequendum was a ""detainer"" entitling a prisoner to the protections provided by the Agreement (544 F2d 588). In the second case (No. 77-52), the United States filed a detainer with Massachusetts officials while a prisoner was being held on Massachusetts charges. After his conviction on the Massachusetts charges, and after the prisoner had been indicted on the federal charges, the prisoner was produced from Massachusetts for arraignment in the United States District Court for the Southern District of New York pursuant to a writ of habeas corpus ad prosequendum. After the prisoner pleaded not guilty to the federal charges, and after a trial date was set, the trial was postponed several times, at the government's request or on the court's own initiative, until approximately 17 months after the prisoner had been produced under the ad prosequendum writ. The District Court denied the prisoner's motions to dismiss the indictment on speedy trial grounds, and a jury trial resulted in the prisoner's conviction. On appeal, the United States Court of Appeals for the Second Circuit reversed, holding that (1) since the government had filed a detainer, triggering the Agreement's provisions, the ad prosequendum writ constituted a ""written request for temporary custody"" under the Agreement, and (2) the federal indictment should have been dismissed, since the government had violated the Agreement's requirement that trial must be commenced within 120 days of the prisoner's arrival in the receiving state (550 F2d 732).",lexis

"The Agricultural Marketing Agreement Act of 1937 (AMAA), which was enacted to stabilize prices for agricultural commodities, regulates only ""handlers,"" i.e., ""processors, associations of producers, and others engaged in the handling"" of covered agricultural commodities, 7 U. S. C. ¬ß608c(1). Any handler that violates the Secretary of Agriculture's marketing orders may be subject to civil and criminal penalties. ¬ß¬ß608a(5), 608a(6), and 608c(14). One such order, the California Raisin Marketing Order (Marketing Order or Order), established a Raisin Administrative Committee (RAC), which recommends setting up annual reserve pools of raisins that are not to be sold on the open domestic market, and which recommends what portion of a particular year's production should be included in the pool. The Order also requires handlers to pay assessments to help cover the RAC's administrative costs. Petitioners, California raisin growers, started a business that processed more than 3 million pounds of raisins from their farm and 60 other farms during the two crop years. When they refused to surrender the requisite portions of raisins to the reserve, the United States Department of Agriculture (USDA) began administrative proceedings, alleging that petitioners were handlers who were required to retain raisins in reserve and pay assessments. Petitioners countered that as producers, they were not subject to the Order. They also raised an affirmative defense that the Order violated the Fifth Amendment's prohibition against taking property without just compensation. An Administrative Law Judge found that petitioners were handlers, found that they had violated the AMAA and the Marketing Order, and rejected their takings defense. On appeal, a judicial officer agreed that petitioners were handlers who had violated the Marketing Order, imposed fines and civil penalties, and declined to address the takings claim. Petitioners sought review in the Federal District Court. Granting summary judgment to the USDA, it found that substantial evidence supported the agency's determination that petitioners were handlers rather than producers, and it rejected petitioners' takings claim. The Ninth Circuit affirmed. It agreed that petitioners were handlers subject to the Marketing Order, but concluded that it lacked jurisdiction to resolve the takings claim, which they should have raised in the Court of Federal Claims. It recognized that when a handler raises a takings defense, Court of Federal Claims Tucker Act jurisdiction gives way to the AMAA's comprehensive remedial scheme, see 7 U. S. C. ¬ß608c(15), but found that petitioners had brought the takings claim in their capacity as producers.",lexis

The contract had been negotiated on the Tennessee merchant's behalf by an independent Mississippi broker who, while not authorized to execute contracts for the merchant, followed the practice of telephoning the necessary information to the merchant at its Tennessee office, where a contract was prepared and signed by the merchant and forwarded to the broker to obtain the farmer's signature. The Tennessee merchant had no office or warehouse in Mississippi, and no employees soliciting business or otherwise operating in the state on a regular basis; and the cotton purchased by the merchant in Mississippi was delivered to a local warehouse for sorting and classifying prior to its shipment in interstate or foreign commerce under the merchant's contracts for sale of the cotton to customers outside the state. The trial court entered judgment for the merchant, but the Supreme Court of Mississippi reversed, holding that (1) pursuant to a Mississippi statute, the suit could not be maintained in the state courts because of the Tennessee merchant's failure to obtain a certificate of authority to qualify to do business in the state, and (2) the merchant's transactions with Mississippi farmers were wholly intrastate in nature, since they were complete upon delivery of the cotton at the local warehouse, it being irrelevant that the merchant might subsequently sell the cotton in interstate commerce (276 So 2d 678).",lexis

The officer seized the gun, and the driver was promptly arrested. After a motion to suppress the gun as evidence was denied, the driver was convicted, in the Supreme Court of Bronx County, New York, for illegal possession of a weapon. The Appellate Division of the Supreme Court, First Department, affirmed the conviction without opinion (97 App Div 2d 741, 468 NYS2d 892), but the New York Court of Appeals reversed, holding (1) that a police officer's nonconsensual entry into an individual's car to determine the vehicle identification number violates the Federal and New York Constitutions where it is based solely on a stop for a traffic infraction; (2) that the Fourth Amendment protects people from unreasonable government intrusions into their legitimate expectations of privacy; (3) that the area underneath the seat of a car is one which a person legitimately expects to remain private; and (4) that in the present case, the officer's intrusion into the car in an effort to learn the vehicle identification number was not justified by the traffic violations which had occurred, in the absence of reason to suspect that the car was stolen (63 NY2d 491, 483 NYS2d 181, 472 NE2d 1009).",lexis
"A passenger was injured when an unarmed Oklahoma county deputy pulled the passenger from a truck which had been stopped after a police chase. The passenger filed a Federal District Court suit which included a claim that the county, on the basis of the county sheriff's prior decision to hire the deputy--and more specifically, on the basis of the sheriff's allegedly inadequate screening of the deputy's background--ought to be held liable under 42 USCS 1983 for the deputy's alleged use of excessive force on the passenger. Before trial, counsel for the county stipulated that the sheriff had been the policymaker for the county in regard to the sheriff's department. At trial, the sheriff's own testimony indicated that he had made only a limited screening of the deputy's background, while there was evidence that this background had included a misdemeanor conviction for assault and battery and various other misdemeanor convictions. The District Court denied two motions by the county, at the close of the passenger's case and at the close of all of the evidence, for judgment as a matter of law. Also, the District Court instructed the jury that with respect to the county's liability, the passenger had to prove that the sheriff's inadequate screening of the deputy's background was so likely to result in violations of constitutional rights that the sheriff could reasonably be said to have been deliberately indifferent to the passenger's constitutional needs. The jury, through answers to special interrogatories, concluded that (1) the deputy had arrested the passenger with excessive force, and (2) the county's hiring policy, in the case of the deputy as ""instituted"" by the sheriff as the county's policymaker, had been so inadequate as to amount to deliberate indifference to the passenger's constitutional needs. The District Court entered judgment for the passenger on the issue of the county's liability. On appeal, a panel of the United States Court of Appeals for the Fifth Circuit initially concluded that (1) the jury's verdict ought to stand, and (2) the judgment ought to be affirmed (53 F.3d 1410).

The District Court granted the officer's motion for summary judgment. A panel of the United States Court of Appeals for the Fourth Circuit affirmed, finding that the inmate would not be deprived of a meaningful opportunity to present his case in state court even if the officer could make out a defense of sovereign immunity (720 F2d 792). On rehearing en banc, the Court of Appeals again affirmed, holding that the negligent infliction of bodily injury does not constitute a deprivation of any interest protected by the due process clause, and that the inmate had an adequate remedy in state court, since the ministerial nature of the officer's duties would have precluded him from successfutly defending on the ground of sovereign immunity (748 F2d 229).",lexis

Under 26 USCS 3306(b)(1), annual wages subject to Federal Unemployment Tax Act (FUTA) (26 USCS 3301 et seq.) tax are similarly limited, by excluding from ""wages"" any remuneration paid to an individual by an employer during a calendar year that exceeds an annual ceiling.

After the judgment creditors introduced portions of the record in the fraud case, the Bankruptcy Court found that all the elements required to establish actual fraud under 523 had been proved and that the doctrine of collateral estoppel required a holding that the debt was therefore not dischargeable, notwithstanding the debtor's contention that collateral estoppel did not apply inasmuch as the jury instructions in the fraud trial merely required that fraud be proved by a preponderance of the evidence, whereas 523 requires proof by clear and convincing evidence (73 BR 26).

Once a person became subject to SORNA's registration requirements, which could have occurred only after the statute's effective date, that person could have been convicted under ¬¨√ü 2250 if he thereafter traveled and then failed to register. The statutory context strongly supported a forward-looking construction of ""travels."" Congress intended ¬¨√ü 2250 to do exactly what it said: to subject to federal prosecution sex offenders who eluded SORNA's registration requirements by traveling in interstate commerce. Liability under ¬¨√ü 2250 could not have been predicated on pre-SORNA travel. Defendant relocated prior to SORNA's enactment. The Supreme Court did not address the ex post facto question.",lexis
"The Biologics Price Competition and Innovation Act of 2009 (BPCIA or Act) provides an abbreviated pathway for obtaining Food and Drug Administration (FDA) approval of a drug that is biosimilar to an already licensed biological product (reference product). 42 U. S. C. ¬ß262(k). It also provides procedures for resolving patent disputes between biosimilar manufacturers (applicants) and manufacturers of reference products (sponsors). ¬ß262(). The Act treats the mere submission of a biosimilar application as an ""artificial"" act of infringement, enabling parties to bring patent infringement actions at certain points in the application process even if the applicant has not committed a traditional act of patent infringement. See 35 U. S. C. ¬ß¬ß271(e)(2)(C)(i), (ii). Under ¬ß262(l)(2)(A), an applicant seeking FDA approval of a biosimilar must provide its application and manufacturing information to the sponsor within 20 days of the date the FDA notifies the applicant that it has accepted the application for review. This triggers an exchange of information between the applicant and sponsor designed to create lists of relevant patents and flesh out potential legal arguments. ¬ß262(l)(3). The BPCIA then channels the parties into two phases of patent litigation. In the first, the parties collaborate to identify patents on the lists for immediate litigation. The second phase-triggered when the applicant, pursuant to ¬ß262(l)(8)(A), gives the sponsor notice at least 180 days before commercially marketing the biosimilar-involves any listed patents not litigated in the first phase. The applicant has substantial control over the timing and scope of both phases of litigation. Failure to comply with these procedural requirements may lead to two consequences relevant here. Under ¬ß262()(9)(C), if an applicant fails to provide its application and manufacturing information to the sponsor under ¬ß262()(2)(A), then the sponsor, but not the applicant, may immediately bring an action ""for a declaration of infringement, validity, or enforceability of any patent that claims the biological product or a use of the biological product."" And under ¬ß262()(9)(B), if an applicant provides the application and manufacturing information but fails to complete a subsequent step in the process, the sponsor, but not the applicant, may bring a declaratory-judgment action with respect to any patent included on the sponsor's list of relevant patents. Neupogen is a filgrastim product marketed by Amgen, which claims to hold patents on methods of manufacturing and using filgrastim. Sandoz sought FDA approval to market a biosimilar filgrastim product under the brand name Zarxio, with Neupogen as the reference product. A day after the FDA informed Sandoz that its application had been accepted for review, Sandoz notified Amgen that it had submitted an application and that it intended to market Zarxio immediately upon receiving FDA approval. It later informed Amgen that it did not intend to provide the application and manufacturing information required by ¬ß262()(2)(A) and that Amgen could sue immediately for infringement under ¬ß262()(9)(C). Amgen sued Sandoz for patent infringement and also asserted that Sandoz engaged in ""unlawful"" conduct in violation of California's unfair competition law. This latter claim was predicated on two alleged violations of the BPCIA: Sandoz's failure to provide its application and manufacturing information under ¬ß262()(2)(A), and its provision of notice of commercial marketing under ¬ß262()(8)(A) prior to obtaining licensure from the FDA. Amgen sought injunctions to enforce both BPCIA requirements. Sandoz counterclaimed for declaratory judgments that the asserted patent was invalid and not infringed and that it had not violated the BPCIA. While the case was pending, the FDA licensed Zarxio, and Sandoz provided Amgen a further notice of commercial marketing. The District Court subsequently granted partial judgment on the pleadings to Sandoz on its BPCIA counterclaims and dismissed Amgen's unfair competition claims with prejudice. The Federal Circuit affirmed in part, vacated in part, and remanded. The court affirmed the dismissal of Amgen's state-law claim based on Sandoz's alleged violation of ¬ß262()(2)(A), holding that Sandoz did not violate the BPCIA in failing to disclose its application and manufacturing information and that the BPCIA provides the exclusive remedies for failure to comply with this requirement. The court also held that under ¬ß262(l)(8)(A) an applicant must provide notice of commercial marketing after obtaining licensure, and that this requirement is mandatory. It thus enjoined Sandoz from marketing Zarxio until 180 days after the date it provided its second notice.",lexis
"The Federal Government brought an in rem civil forfeiture action in the United States District Court for the Southern District of Florida against a single-family residence, located in the district, which allegedly had been purchased with the proceeds of narcotics trafficking, so as to be subject to forfeiture under 511(a)(6) of the Comprehensive Drug Abuse Prevention and Control Act of 1970 (21 USCS 881(a)(6)). A bank filed a claim asserting a lien interest in the residence and thereafter agreed to a sale of the residence. The proceeds of the sale were retained by the United States Marshal pending disposition of the case. After a trial on the merits, the District Court entered a judgment denying the bank's claim with prejudice and forfeiting the proceeds to the United States. The bank filed a timely notice of appeal to the United States Court of Appeals for the Eleventh Circuit, but did not post a supersedeas bond or file a motion to stay execution of the judgment. At the Government's request, the Marshal transferred the proceeds of the sale to the Assets Forfeiture Fund of the United States Treasury. The Government then moved to dismiss the appeal for want of jurisdiction, and this motion was granted by the Court of Appeals, which held that the removal of the proceeds of the sale from the district terminated the District Court's in rem jurisdiction (932 F2d 1433).",lexis

"The Immigration and Nationality Act provides the framework for acquisition of U. S. citizenship from birth by a child born abroad, when one parent is a U.

S.-citizen parent to have ten years‚Äô physical presence in the United States prior to the child‚Äôs birth, ‚Äúat least five of which were after attaining‚Äù age 14. The rule is made applicable to unwed U. S.-citizen fathers by ¬ß1409(a), but ¬ß1409(c) creates an exception for an unwed U. S.-citizen mother, whose citizenship can be transmitted to a child born abroad if she has lived continuously in the United States for just one year prior to the child‚Äôs birth. Respondent Luis Ram√≥n Morales-Santana, who has lived in the United States since he was 13, asserts U. S. citizenship at birth based on the U. S. citizenship of his biological father, Jos√© Morales. Jos√© moved to the Dominican Republic 20 days short of his 19th birthday, therefore failing to satisfy ¬ß1401(a)(7)‚Äôs requirement of five years‚Äô physical presence after age 14. There, he lived with the Dominican woman who gave birth to Morales-Santana. Jos√© accepted parental responsibility and included Morales-Santana in his household; he married Morales-Santana‚Äôs mother and his name was then added to hers on Morales-Santana‚Äôs birth certificate. In 2000, the Government sought to remove Morales-Santana based on several criminal convictions, ranking him as alien because, at his time of birth, his father did not satisfy the requirement of five years‚Äô physical presence after age 14. An immigration judge rejected MoralesSantana‚Äôs citizenship claim and ordered his removal. Morales¬≠ Santana later moved to reopen the proceedings, asserting that the Government‚Äôs refusal to recognize that he derived citizenship from his U. S.-citizen father violated the Constitution‚Äôs equal protection guarantee. The Board of Immigration Appeals denied the motion, but the Second Circuit reversed. Relying on this Court‚Äôs post-1970 construction of the equal protection principle as it bears on genderbased classifications, the court held unconstitutional the differential treatment of unwed mothers and fathers. To cure this infirmity, the Court of Appeals held that Morales-Santana derived citizenship through his father, just as he would were his mother the U. S. citizen.",lexis
"A Montana statute provides that, subject to certain restrictions, the State Board of Pardons (parole board) ""shall release on parole ... any person confined in the Montana state prison ... when in its opinion there is reasonable probability that the prisoner can be released without detriment to the prisoner or to the community."" The statute further provides that a prisoner ""shall be placed on parole only when the board believes that he is able and willing to fulfill the obligations of a law-abiding citizen."" Two inmates of the Montana state prison, after being denied parole, filed an action in the United States District Court for the District of Montana under 42 USCS 1983 on behalf of a class of all present and future inmates of the state prison who were or might become eligible for parole. Seeking declaratory and injunctive relief as well as compensatory damages, the complaint alleged that the parole board violated the inmates' rights under the Fourteenth Amendment's due process clause by (1) failing to apply statutorily mandated criteria in determining inmates' eligibility for parole, and (2) failing to explain adequately its reasons for denial of parole. The District Court dismissed the action, holding that the inmates were not entitled to due process protections in connection with the board's denial of parole, since the board's discretion was too broad to provide a prisoner with a constitutionally protected liberty interest in parole release. The United States Court of Appeals for the Ninth Circuit reversed, holding that (1) the statute's use of the mandatory term ""shall"" indicated that under the statute, the board may not deny parole once it determines that harm is not probable, and (2) the provisions of the Montana statute were comparable to those of a Nebraska statute that was held in Greenholtz v Nebraska Penal Inmates, 442 US 1, 60 L Ed 2d 668, 99 S Ct 2100, to create an expectancy of release and thus a liberty interest (792 F2d 1404).",lexis

Holding that the research company had misused its patents, the District Court awarded the manufacturer treble damages and injunctive relief against the research company; and further holding that the research company and its parent corporation had conspired in restraint of trade, the District Court, relying upon a pretrial stipulation that the research company and its parent corporation were to be considered as an entity for purposes of the litigation, awarded the manufacturer treble damages and injunctive relief against both the research company and its parent corporation (239 F Supp 51). On appeal, the Court of Appeals for the Seventh Circuit, affirming the treble damage award for patent misuse, but otherwise reversing the judgment of the District Court, (1) held that the District Court lacked jurisdiction over the research company's parent corporation, and that the stipulation relied upon by the District Court was an insufficient basis for entering judgment against the parent corporation, (2) modified in certain respects the District Court's injunction against patent misuse, (3) held that the manufacturer had failed to prove that it had sustained damage as a result of the conspiracy in restraint of trade, and (4) struck the injunction against the research company's participation in conspiracies restricting the manufacturer's trade in foreign markets (388 F2d 25).",lexis

Subsequent to the filing of the grievance, the employee also filed a state court action against her employer in the Illinois Circuit Court for Williamson County, alleging that she had been discharged for exercising her rights under the Illinois worker's compensation statute, under which compensatory and punitive damages for an employer's retaliatory discharge could be recovered.

After a penalty hearing, the jury recommended the death penalty on both aggravated murder counts and terms of imprisonment for the attempted murders. The trial court sentenced Mitts to death for the aggravated murders and to terms of imprisonment for the attempted murders. The Ohio Court of Appeals affirmed Mitts' convictions and sentences, and the Ohio Supreme Court affirmed the convictions and sentences and denied rehearing, ruling that the trial court should have instructed the jury to merge duplicative death penalty specifications, but holding that the error did not influence the jury and was resolved by re-weighing on appeal. Mitts filed a petition for a writ of habeas corpus. A federal judge in Cleveland affirmed the sentence, but the United States Court of Appeals for the Sixth Circuit decided to vacate.",lexis
"Under 1561(a) of the Internal Revenue Code of 1954 (26 USCS 1561(a)), as it formerly read, a ""controlled group of corporations"" was limited to a single corporate surtax exemption. Section 1563(a)(2) of the Code (26 USCS 1563(a)(2)) provides that a ""controlled group of corporations"" includes a ""brother-sister controlled group,"" defined as ""[t]wo or more corporations if 5 or fewer persons ... own ... stock possessing (A) at least 80 percent of the total combined voting power ... or at least 80 percent of the total value ... of each corporation, and (B) more than 50 percent of the total combined voting power ... or more than 50 percent of the total value ... of each corporation, taking into account the stock ownership of each such person only to the extent such stock ownership is identical with respect to each such corporation,"" and a Treasury Regulation ( 26 CFR 1.1563-1(a)(3)) interpreting that statutory provision states that the term ""brother-sister controlled group"" means two or more corporations if the same five or fewer persons own ""singly or in combination"" the two prescribed percentages of voting power or total value. A fertilizer corporation--77.49 percent of whose stock was owned by an individual who held 87.5 percent of the voting power of another corporation, and the remaining 22.51 percent of whose stock was owned by an unrelated individual who owned no stock in the second corporation--did not claim a full surtax exemption on its tax returns, believing that the Treasury regulation barred such a claim. However, the corporation subsequently filed timely claims for refunds, asserting that it and the other corporation were not members of a controlled group and that it was therefore entitled to a full surtax exemption for each taxable year. The Internal Revenue Service disallowed the claims, and the corporation brought a suit for a refund in the United States Court of Claims. The Court of Claims held that two corporations did not constitute a brother-sister controlled group within the meaning of 1563(a)(2), that the Treasury regulation was invalid to the extent that it took into account, with respect to the 80-percent requirement, stock held by a shareholder who owns stock in only one corporation of the controlled group, and that the corporation was therefore entitled to a refund (634 F2d 497).",lexis
"In two separate incidents, officers of a Texas county's narcotics unit, executing search warrants, supposedly made forcible entries into private homes in fruitless searches for evidence of narcotics activity, in the course of which the officers allegedly shot two dogs to death in one home and assaulted the homeowner in the other. In an action under 42 USCS 1983 in the United States District Court for the Northern District of Texas against some local officials in their official capacity, the county, two cities, and the narcotics unit, the homeowners asserted that (1) the officers' conduct had violated the Federal Constitution's Fourth Amendment, and (2) the municipalities were liable for these violations due to their alleged failure adequately to train the officers involved on the proper manner to execute search warrants and to respond when confronted by family dogs. The complaint alleged no underlying facts other than the events of the searches to support the assertion that the municipalities had adopted policies, customs, and practices condoning the officers' conduct. The District Court held that the conclusionary allegations of the complaint as to inadequate training did not meet the ""heightened pleading standard"" required for such claims under decisions of the United States Court of Appeals for the Fifth Circuit, and accordingly dismissed all claims against all of the defendants (755 F Supp 726).

The Postal Service appealed the injunction ruling on prize lists, the organization cross-appealed the ruling on advertisements, and the United States Supreme Court noted probable jurisdiction of both appeals.

"Petitioner Merck Sharp & Dohme Corp. manufactures Fosamax, a drug that treats and prevents osteoporosis in postmenopausal women. However, the mechanism through which Fosamax treats and prevents osteoporosis may increase the risk that patients will suffer ‚Äúatypical femoral fractures,‚Äù that is, a rare type of complete, low-energy fracture that affects the thigh bone. When the Food and Drug Administration first approved of the manufacture and sale of Fosamax in 1995, the Fosamax label did not warn of the then-speculative risk of atypical femoral fractures associated with the drug. But stronger evidence connecting Fosamax to atypical femoral fractures developed after 1995. And the FDA ultimately ordered Merck to add a warning about atypical femoral fractures to the Fosamax label in 2011.
Respondents are more than 500 individuals who took Fosamax and suffered atypical femoral fractures between 1999 and 2010. Respondents sued Merck seeking tort damages on the ground that state law imposed upon Merck a legal duty to warn respondents and their doctors about the risk of atypical femoral fractures associated with using Fosamax. Merck, in defense, argued that respondents‚Äô state-law failure-to-warn claims should be dismissed as pre-empted by federal law. Merck conceded that the FDA regulations would have permitted Merck to try to change the label to add a warning before 2010, but Merck asserted that the FDA would have rejected that attempt. In particular, Merck claimed that the FDA's rejection of Merck's 2008 attempt to warn of a risk of ‚Äústress fractures‚Äù showed that the FDA would also have rejected any attempt by Merck to warn of the risk of atypical femoral fractures associated with the drug.
The District Court agreed with Merck's pre-emption argument and granted summary judgment to Merck, but the Third Circuit vacated and remanded. The Court of Appeals recognized that its pre-emption analysis was controlled by this Court's decision in Wyeth v. Levine, 555 U. S. 555, 129 S.Ct. 1187, 173 L.Ed.2d 51, which held that a state-law failure-to-warn claim is pre-empted where there is ‚Äúclear evidence‚Äù that the FDA would not have approved a change to the label. The Court of Appeals, however, suggested that the ‚Äúclear evidence‚Äù standard had led to varying lower court applications and that it would be helpful for this Court to ‚Äúclarif[y] or buil[d] out the doctrine.‚Äù 852 F. 3d 268, 284.",lexis

An independent candidate who was certified as qualified to appear on the ballot for the seat in question requested permission to participate in the debate. AETC's executive director, in denying the request, asserted that AETC had made a bona fide journalistic judgment that the viewers would be best served by limiting the debate to the two major-party candidates who had already been invited.

The defendants argued that federal law precluded the exercise of state jurisdiction. After protracted litigation the plaintiff obtained a judgment which was affirmed by the Ohio Court of Appeals. (90 Ohio L Abs 65, 187 NE2d 407.) The court rejected the contention that the state was without jurisdiction. The Supreme Court of Ohio dismissed an appeal for the reason that no debatable constitutional question was involved. (173 Ohio St 576, 20 Ohio Ops 2d 174, 184 NE2d 100.)",lexis
"In disbarment proceedings before the Ohio Board of Bar Commissioners on Grievances and Discipline, the petitioner, an active trial lawyer who handled many Federal Employers' Liability Act cases, was found to have engaged in misconduct consisting of hiring a railroad car inspector, during his off- duty hours, to investigate FELA claims against the inspector's employer. This charge of misconduct was not in the original charges against the petitioner, but was added as a result of testimony presented during the disbarment hearings. Although the petitioner was granted a continuance in order to have time to respond to the new charge, his motion to strike the charge was denied. On appeal from the Board's finding that the petitioner was guilty of misconduct, the Ohio Supreme Court sustained this charge and indefinitely suspended the petitioner from the practice of law.

"The Secretary of Labor instituted an action against partners engaged in managing apartment complexes owned by others in the United States District Court for the Eastern District of Virginia, seeking an injunction against the partnership's future violations of the wage and record-keeping provisions of the Fair Labor Standards Act, and back wages allegedly due to maintenance workers at the apartment complexes for periods before February 1, 1969, such workers having been paid from rentals collected for the apartment owners by the partnership. In managing the apartment complexes, the partnership performed virtually all normal management and operational functions, including executing leases, collecting rents, paying operating expenses from the rents, and receiving as compensation a commission based on a fixed percentage of gross rentals. Dismissing the complaint, the District Court held that for purposes of the Act, the partnership was not an ""employer"" of the maintenance workers, and that since the partnership's gross annual commissions from the apartment complex owners was less than $ 500,000, the partnership was not a covered enterprise under 3(s)(1) of the Act, which limits enterprises covered by the Act through January 31, 1969, to those having an annual gross volume of ""sales made or business done"" of at least $ 500,000 (312 F Supp 608). The United States Court of Appeals for the Fourth Circuit reversed and remanded, holding that (1) the partnership was an employer of the maintenance workers under 3(d) of the Act, which defines ""employer"" as any person acting directly or indirectly in the interest of an employer in relation to an employee, and (2) the partnership was a covered enterprise since the dollar-volume limitation of ""sales made or business done"" under 3(s)(1) was to be measured by the gross rentals collected by the partnership at all the apartment complexes, which exceeded $ 500,000 annually, rather than by the partnership's commissions (439 F2d 340).

"An accused and his codefendant were tried by a jury in the United States District Court for the District of Arizona for narcotics and weapons offenses. As instructed by Rule 24(b) of the Federal Rules of Criminal Procedure, the District Court allotted 10 peremptory challenges to the codefendants that could be used jointly in the selection of 12 jurors. When a prospective juror indicated on his questionnaire and in his discussion with the trial judge that he would favor the prosecution, the codefendants challenged the juror for cause, but the District Court declined to excuse the juror. After two unsuccessful objections to the for-cause ruling, the accused used a peremptory challenge to remove the juror. Subsequently, the codefendants exhausted all of their peremptory challenges. When jury selection was completed, the District Court read the names of the jurors to be seated and asked if the prosecutor or defense counsel had any objections to any of those jurors. Counsel for the accused responded: ""None from us."" At the conclusion of the trial, the accused was convicted on all counts. On appeal, the accused contended that (1) the District Court abused its discretion in refusing to strike the juror for cause, and (2) this error forced the accused to use a peremptory challenge on the juror. The United States Court of Appeals for the Ninth Circuit expressed the view that (1) the District Court's refusal to strike the juror for cause was an abuse of discretion; (2) the error did not violate the Federal Constitution's Sixth Amendment, because the juror was removed and the impartiality of the jury ultimately seated was not challenged; (3) the District Court's mistake resulted in a violation of the accused's due process rights under the Constitution's Fifth Amendment, since the District Court's error in denying the for-cause challenge forced the accused to use a peremptory challenge curatively, thereby impairing his right to the full complement of peremptory challenges to which he was entitled under federal law; and (4) such an error required automatic reversal (146 F3d 653, 1998 US App LEXIS 10899).",lexis
"A defendant was convicted in a state court on charges of burglary, assault, and murder. After the murder conviction was set aside, a prosecutor proposed to the defendant's attorney that in exchange for a guilty plea to the charge of accessory after a felony murder, the prosecutor would recommend a 21-year sentence to be served concurrently with the burglary and assault sentences. When the defendant's attorney notified the prosecutor that the defendant accepted the offer, the prosecutor told him that a mistake had been made, withdrew that offer, and proposed instead that in exchange for the guilty plea he would recommend a sentence to be served consecutively with the defendant's other sentences. The defendant rejected the new offer and elected to stand trial, but after a mistrial was declared, he accepted the second offer, and the state trial judge then imposed in accordance with the plea bargain a 21-year sentence to be served consecutively to the other sentences. After exhausting his state remedies, the defendant filed a petition for a writ of habeas corpus, which the United States District Court dismissed. The United States Court of Appeals for the Eighth Circuit reversed, holding that fairness precluded the prosecution's withdrawal of the plea proposal once the defendant accepted it (707 F2d 323).",lexis
"In connection with the lease of a motion-picture theater, a film franchise agreement was executed between lessor and lessee for the term of the lease; it licensed the lessee to exhibit motion pictures distributed by the lessor. The lease provided that it was terminable at the lessor's option if the franchise agreement was terminated for any reason. While the lease was in force, a decree entered in a government anti-trust action against the lessor enjoined the lessor from performing license agreements of the kind involved in the present case. Relying upon that decree the lessor filed an eviction suit to cancel the lease. The lessee answered setting up various defenses and filed counterclaims seeking treble damages under the anti-trust acts, alleging that a conspiracy between lessor and other motion-picture companies resulted in the imposition of excessive terms on the lessee by the lease and franchise agreement. The trial court ordered the lessor's action tried separately from the lessee's counterclaims. Prior to trial the Supreme Court of the United States, while sustaining the decree in the government anti-trust action as to the existence of a conspiracy among the defendants, reversed that portion of the decree which held that franchises were illegal per se. The lessor then alleged that the provisions of the franchise agreement, apart from any conspiracy and independent of the decree in the government action, rendered the agreement an illegal contract in restraint of trade under the Sherman Act. A judgment was rendered for lessee; the judgment was based upon a finding, adopted over the lessee's objection, that neither lease nor license agreement was the result of an unlawful conspiracy. For the same reason and without separate trial on the merits, the lessee's counterclaims were dismissed with prejudice. The lessee did not appeal from the finding adopted over its objection in the lessor's action, but only from the dismissal of its counterclaims without separate trial.",lexis
"What seems to have been significant in previous class-of-one cases was the existence of a clear standard against which departures, even for a single plaintiff, could be readily assessed. Other forms of state action, however, by their nature involved discretionary decisionmaking based on a vast array of subjective, individualized assessments. Employment decisions were quite often subjective and individualized. Recognition of a class-of-one theory of equal protection in the public employment context was contrary to the concept of at-will employment; the Constitution did not require repudiating the at-will doctrine. Recognizing the sort of claim the employee was pressing could have jeopardized the delicate balance governments have struck between the rights of public employees and the government's legitimate purpose in promoting efficiency and integrity in the discharge of official duties, and in maintaining proper discipline in the public service. Government offices could not function if every employment decision became a constitutional matter and ratifying a class-of-one theory in the context of public employment would have impermissibly constitutionalized the employee grievance.",lexis

"At a time when an employer and a labor union were parties to a collective bargaining agreement--which prohibited the union from striking against the employer and, through a separate memorandum agreement, required the employer to notify the union before agreeing to subcontract out work that otherwise would be performed by union members he employer announced a plan to subcontract out work that would cause approximately one-half of the union members to lose their jobs. The union filed in the United States Court for the Middle District of Pennsylvania a complaint (1) alleging that the employer--through its failure, despite the union's repeated requests, to disclose the existence of a plan to subcontract out work that would otherwise be performed by union members--had fraudulently induced the union to sign the collective bargaining agreement, and (2) seeking compensatory and punitive damages, as well as a declaratory judgment that the agreement was voidable at the union's option. The union, which did not allege that either the union or the employer had violated the agreement, invoked, as the basis of federal subject matter jurisdiction, 301(a) of the Labor Management Relations Act (29 USCS 185(a)), which conferred federal subject matter jurisdiction over ""suits for violation of contracts"" between an employer and a labor organization.

The officials removed the action to the United States District Court for the Northern District of Alabama, and the District Court (1) granted summary judgment to the officials, and (2) expressed the view that any federal employee was entitled to absolute immunity for ordinary torts committed within the scope of the employee's job.

"The Bank Secrecy Act (BSA) and its implementing regulations require U. S. persons with certain financial interests in foreign accounts to file an annual report known as an ‚ÄúFBAR‚Äù‚Äîthe Report of Foreign Bank and Financial Accounts. The statute imposes a maximum $10,000 penalty for nonwillful violations of the law. These reports are designed to help the government trace funds that may be used for illicit purposes and identify unreported income that may be subject to taxation. Petitioner Alexandru Bittner‚Äîa dual citizen of Romania and the United States‚Äîlearned of his BSA reporting obligations after he returned to the United States from Romania in 2011, and he subsequently submitted the required annual reports covering five years (2007 through 2011).

Bittner filed corrected FBARs providing information for each of his accounts‚Äî61 accounts in 2007, 51 in 2008, 53 in 2009 and 2010, and 54 in 2011. The government neither contested the accuracy of Bittner‚Äôs new filings nor suggested that Bittner‚Äôs previous errors were willful. But because the government took the view that nonwillful penalties apply to each account not accurately or timely reported, and because Bittner‚Äôs five latefiled annual reports collectively involved 272 accounts, the government calculated the penalty due at $2.72 million. Bittner challenged that penalty in court, arguing that the BSA authorizes a maximum penalty for nonwillful violations of $10,000 per report, not $10,000 per account.

"In 1958, the state of Vermont made a tax assessment against a solvent taxpayer, and approximately 3 1/2 months later, the United States made a tax assessment against the same taxpayer.

When respondent Black objected on First Amendment grounds to his trial court's jury instruction that cross burning by itself is sufficient evidence from which the required ""intent to intimidate"" could be inferred, the prosecutor responded that the instruction was taken straight out of the Virginia Model Instructions. Respondent O'Mara pleaded guilty to charges of violating the statute, but reserved the right to challenge its constitutionality. At respondent Elliott's trial, the judge instructed the jury as to what the Commonwealth had to prove, but did not give an instruction on the meaning of the word ""intimidate,"" nor on the statute's prima facie evidence provision.

"Petitioners (collectively CARCO) sub-chartered the oil tanker M/T Athos I from tanker operator Star Tankers, which had chartered the tanker from respondent Frescati Shipping Company. In the final stretch of the tanker’s journey from Venezuela to New Jersey, an abandoned ship anchor punctured the tanker’s hull, causing 264,000 gallons of heavy crude oil to spill into the Delaware River. The Oil Pollution Act of 1990, 33 U. S. C. §2702(a), required Frescati, the vessel’s owner, to cover the cleanup costs in the first instance. Pursuant to the statute, Frescati’s liability was limited to $45 million, and the Oil Spill Liabil- ity Trust Fund, operated by the Federal Government (also a respond- ent here), reimbursed Frescati for an additional $88 million in cleanup costs.
Frescati and the United States then sued CARCO to recover their respective portions of the cleanup costs. Both alleged that CARCO was ultimately at fault for the oil spill because CARCO had breached a con- tractual “safe-berth clause” in the subcharter agreement (“charter party”) between CARCO and Star Tankers. According to Frescati and the United States, that clause obligated CARCO to select a “safe” berth that would allow the vessel to come and go “always safely afloat,” and that obligation amounted to a warranty regarding the safety of the se- lected berth. After concluding that Frescati was an implied third- party beneficiary of the safe-berth clause, the Third Circuit held that the clause embodied an express warranty of safety made without re- gard to the charterer’s diligence in selecting the berth.",lexis

"In 1979, construction of a gasohol plant was begun by a corporation which was owned by the general manager of a farming cooperative. In January 1980, the general manager began taking loans from the cooperative to finance the construction of the plant. In November 1980, the board of directors of the cooperative agreed to purchase the corporation from the general manager. One month later, however, the cooperative, alleging that the general manager actually had sold the corporation to the cooperative in February 1980, filed a declaratory judgment action against the general manager and the corporation in an Arkansas state court. A consent decree entered thereafter in such action (1) relieved the general manager of approximately $ 4 million of debt to the cooperative; and (2) provided that the cooperative had owned the corporation since February 1980. In January 1981, the general manager and an individual who served as the accountant for both the cooperative and the corporation were convicted of federal tax fraud. Later in 1981, the cooperative retained the services of an accounting firm--one of the members of which had testified for the general manager at the tax fraud trial--to prepare the cooperative's annual financial audit. After consulting with the general manager, reviewing the corporation's books which the accountant for the corporation and the cooperative had prepared, and factoring in construction costs and capitalized expenses for the gasohol plant, the accounting firm (1) concluded that the corporation's fixed-asset value was approximately $ 4.5 million; (2) concluded that the cooperative had owned the corporation from the beginning of construction of the gasohol plant in 1979, which conclusion resulted in a valuation of the corporation for accounting purposes at its fixed-asset value; and (3) stated the value of the corporation at $ 4.5 million in the cooperative's 1981 and 1982 audit reports. (However, if the cooperative had instead been determined to have purchased the corporation from the general manager, then the correct valuation was the fair market value of somewhere between $ 444,000 and $ 1.5 million; and, if the corporation was valued at less than $ 1.5 million, then the cooperative was insolvent.) In February 1984, the cooperative filed for bankruptcy. The cooperative's bankruptcy trustee filed suit in the United States District Court for the Western District of Arkansas against defendants including the accounting firm. Subsequently, the District Court certified a class of persons who had purchased demand notes from the cooperative between February 1980 and February 1984. The complaint included an allegation that the accounting firm had violated 18 USCS 1962(c), a provision of the Racketeer Influenced and Corrupt Organizations (RICO) chapter enacted as Title IX of the Organized Crime Control Act of 1970 (OCCA), under which provision it was unlawful for any person employed by or associated with an interstate enterprise ""to conduct or participate, directly or indirectly, in the conduct of such enterprise's affairs"" through a pattern of racketeering activity. The District Court, however, expressing the view that liability under 1962(c) required some participation in the operation or management of the enterprise itself, granted the accounting firm's motion for summary judgment on the RICO claim.

"Ellis Island lies in New York Harbor about 1,300 feet from the New Jersey shore. There was a longstanding dispute between the states of New Jersey and New York concerning their boundary in the harbor area. Eventually, the two states entered into a boundary compact that was consented to by Congress in 1834 (4 Stat 708), pursuant to the Federal Constitution's compact clause (Art I, 10, cl 3). At that time, Ellis Island comprised about 3 acres. The compact included provisions that (1) in Article First, established a general boundary line--as to which Ellis Island was later held to be on the New Jersey side--that applied except as otherwise mentioned in the compact; and (2) in Article Second, provided that New York would retain its ""present jurisdiction"" over Ellis Island. Meanwhile, New York had (1) in 1800, ceded, with a reservation for the service of judicial process, ""jurisdiction"" over Ellis Island to the United States; and (2) in 1808, granted all of the state's property interest in the island to the United States. The Federal Government used Ellis Island for military purposes until the 1890's, when the location became a major immigration station. From about 1890 to 1934, the Federal Government, in connection with these immigration operations, enlarged the surface area by adding about 24.5 acres of filled land on the submerged lands around Ellis Island. Also, in 1904, New Jersey conveyed to the United States all of the state's property interest in about 48 acres that surrounded Ellis Island. The immigration station was closed in 1954, but the Federal Government retained control of the location and eventually developed it as a national historic site. However, for such purposes as taxation, zoning, environmental protection, and elections, both New Jersey and New York asserted rival claims of sovereign authority over the filled land which the Federal Government had added. In 1993, New Jersey (1) invoked the United States Supreme Court's original jurisdiction under Art III, 2, cl 2 of the Constitution; and (2) sought leave to file a bill of complaint against New York concerning these rival claims to the filled land. The Supreme Court (1) granted New Jersey's petition (511 US 1080, 128 L Ed 2d 458, 114 S Ct 1828), and (2) appointed a special master (513 US 924, 130 L Ed 2d 273, 115 S Ct 309). In 1997, the special master submitted to the Supreme Court a final report and a supplement (520 US ____, 138 L Ed 2d 209, 117 S Ct 2451).

"Under 21 USCS 881(a)(6), proceeds traceable to an unlawful drug transaction are subject to forfeiture to the United States, except to the extent of the interest of an owner by reason of any act or omission established by that owner to have been committed or omitted ""without the knowledge or consent of that owner."" In addition, 21 USCS 881(h), enacted in 1984, provides that all right, title, and interest in property ""described in"" 21 USCS 881(a) shall vest in the United States upon commission of the act giving rise to forfeiture under 21 USCS 881. In 1989, the Federal Government, which filed an in rem action in the United States District Court for the District of New Jersey against a New Jersey parcel of land on which a woman's home was located, alleged that the parcel was subject to forfeiture under 881(a)(6). The woman was granted the right to defend the action. It was established that (1) the woman had purchased the parcel in 1982 using funds given to her; and (2) there was probable cause to believe that those funds were proceeds of illegal drug trafficking. The woman, however, swore that she had no knowledge of the funds' origins, and, in a motion for summary judgment, she claimed that she was an ""innocent owner"" under 881(a)(6). The District Court rejected that claim, on the grounds that (1) the innocent owner defense could be invoked by only those who could demonstrate that they were bona fide purchasers for value; and (2) the statute offered the innocent owner defense only to persons who acquired an interest in a property before the acts giving rise to the forfeiture took place (738 F Supp 854). On interlocutory appeal, the United States Court of Appeals for the Third Circuit ordered a remand to the District Court to determine whether the woman was in fact an innocent owner, as the Court of Appeals (1) expressed the view that the innocent owner defense was not limited to bona fide purchasers for value; and (2) rejected the government's argument to the effect that under the ""relation back"" doctrine embodied in 881(h), the woman could not be an innocent owner unless she had acquired the parcel before the drug transaction had occurred (937 F2d 98).",lexis

"Upon trial in the United States District Court for the Eastern District of Michigan, the respondents, who were the president and the vice-president of a corporation, were convicted, along with the corporation, for violations of the Federal Food, Drug, and Cosmetic Act. Prior to the criminal prosecution, the government had instituted civil condemnation proceedings under the Act and had served interrogatories on the corporation to obtain evidence as to certain of its products. Upon being notified by the Food and Drug Administration that criminal proceedings were contemplated against the corporation and its officers, the corporation sought to stay the civil action, or extend the time for answering the interrogatories until after disposition of any criminal proceedings, on the ground that otherwise the government would improperly obtain evidence for the criminal prosecution by the use of civil discovery proceedings, no claim of the Fifth Amendment privilege against self-incrimination having been asserted with respect to the corporate officers, however. The corporation's motion was denied, and the corporation's vice-president then answered the interrogatories without asserting his Fifth Amendment privilege. In the subsequent criminal prosecution, which was based on an indictment returned after settlement of the civil case, the District Court denied the respondents' pretrial motion to suppress evidence obtained through the interrogatories, holding that the record showed that the government had not acted in bad faith in filing the interrogatories. On appeal, the United States Court of Appeals for the Sixth Circuit reversed the convictions of the corporate officers, on the ground that the government's use of interrogatories to obtain evidence in the nearly contemporaneous civil condemnation proceedings violated the corporate officers' Fifth Amendment privilege against self-incrimination (407 F2d 570).",lexis
"Relying upon the responsibility rules for horse trainers issued by the New York State Racing and Wagering Board as the state agency empowered to license horse trainers and others participating in harness horse race meets in New York, and relying upon the evidentiary presumption arising under the responsibility rules whereby, when a post-race test of a horse reveals the presence of drugs, it is presumed, subject to rebuttal, that the drug was either administered by the trainer or was the result of his negligence in failing to adequately protect against the drugging, a Board steward suspended a horse trainer's New York license for 15 days when, following the running of a harness horse race meet in New York, a post-race urinalysis test revealed the presence of a stimulant drug in the system of a horse which the trainer handled. Rather than resorting to the procedures of a New York law entitling him to a post-suspension hearing, the suspended trainer brought an action in the United States District Court for the Southern District of New York alleging, among other things, that the law governing the procedure for suspended licensees involved in harness racing was unconstitutional under the due process clause of the Fourteenth Amendment because it permitted his license to be suspended without a prior hearing to determine his culpability, and because a summary suspension could not be stayed pending the administrative review provided by the statute, and that the law was also unconstitutional under the equal protection clause of the Fourteenth Amendment, since New York law, although prohibiting stays of license suspensions pending administrative review for trainers involved in harness racing, permitted stays pending appeal of suspensions of licenses for trainers involved in thoroughbred racing. The District Court held, with respect to the trainer's due process claims, that the New York law was unconstitutional since it permitted the state to irreparably sanction a harness racehorse trainer without a presuspension or prompt post-suspension hearing, and, with respect to his equal protection claim, ruled that the difference between the procedures applicable to harness racing and those applicable to thoroughbred racing was so unwarranted as to violate the Fourteenth Amendment's equal protection clause (436 F Supp 775).",lexis

When a disagreement developed between the firm and the S & L concerning the loans, the firm filed suit in the 95th Judicial Court of Dallas County, Texas against the S & L, asserting claims of usury, breach of fiduciary duty, and breach of the implied duty of good faith and fair dealing. Two months after such suit was filed, the Federal Home Loan Bank Board declared the S & L insolvent and appointed the Federal Savings and Loan Insurance Corporation as receiver. The FSLIC then substituted itself for the S & L in the state court case and removed the case to Federal District Court. The District Court dismissed the suit for lack of subject matter jurisdiction, holding that a creditor's claim against the FSLIC as receiver had to be presented first to the FSLIC itself, was subject to review by the Bank Board, and was then subject to review by the federal courts. On appeal, the United States Court of Appeals for the Fifth Circuit affirmed, holding that 12 USCS 1464(d)(6)(C) and 1729(d) gave the FSLIC exclusive jurisdiction over claims by creditors against savings and loan associations under FSLIC receivership (829 F2d 563).",lexis

"The Federal Government provides low-income housing tax credits that are distributed to developers by designated state agencies. In Texas, the Department of Housing and Community Affairs (Department) distributes the credits. The Inclusive Communities Project, Inc. (ICP), a Texas-based nonprofit corporation that assists low-income families in obtaining affordable housing, brought a disparate-impact claim under ¬ß¬ß804(a) and 805(a) of the Fair Housing Act (FHA), alleging that the Department and its officers had caused continued segregated housing patterns by allocating too many tax credits to housing in predominantly black inner-city areas and too few in predominantly white suburban neighborhoods. Relying on statistical evidence, the District Court concluded that the ICP had established a prima face showing of disparate impact. After assuming the Department's proffered non-discriminatory interests were valid, it found that the Department failed to meet its burden to show that there were no less discriminatory alternatives for allocating the tax credits. While the Department's appeal was pending, the Secretary of Housing and Urban Development issued a regulation interpreting the FHA to encompass disparate-impact liability and establishing a burden-shifting framework for adjudicating such claims. The Fifth Circuit held that disparate-impact claims are cognizable under the FHA, but reversed and remanded on the merits, concluding that, in light of the new regulation, the District Court had improperly required the Department to prove less discriminatory alternatives. The FHA was adopted shortly after the assassination of Dr. Martin Luther King, Jr. Recognizing that persistent racial segregation had left predominantly black inner cities surrounded by mostly white suburbs, the Act addresses the denial of housing opportunities on the basis of ""race, color, religion, or national origin.""

A government proving ground shut down for a day and refused to negotiate an employees union's proposal that the day be treated as administrative leave rather than as forced annual leave, as it stated that administrative leave was not permitted by relevant rules and regulations. The union then filed an unfair labor practice charge with the FLRA. An administrative law judge ruled in the proving ground's favor, on the ground that the union's proposal was not negotiable because the FLRA had not previously determined under 7117(b) that there was no compelling need for the regulations in question (21 FLRA 826). The FLRA reversed, as it held (1) that a ""compelling need"" determination may be unified with an unfair labor practice determination, and (2) that the regulation at issue was not justified by a ""compelling need"" (21 FLRA 814).

After the close of the government's case at the trial before the United States District Court for the District of Massachusetts, the defendant moved for an acquittal, arguing that the government had failed to prove that there was a violation of the state statutory section as alleged in the indictment, since the statute cited, as construed by the state courts, did not prohibit numbers betting but applied only to games of competition such as horse races. The District Court denied the motion, but after the defendants had rested, granted a motion to strike all evidence of numbers betting, apparently believing such action to be required by the indictment's failure to set forth the proper state statute. The defendant then moved for a judgment of acquittal, arguing that there was no evidence of his connection with horse-betting activities. The court granted this motion. On appeal by the government, under 18 USCS 3731, from the order excluding the numbers-betting evidence and from the judgment acquitting the defendant, the United States Court of Appeals for the First Circuit vacated the judgment of acquittal and remanded the case for a new trial on the numbers-betting charge, holding that it had jurisdiction of the appeal from the dismissal of the numbers charge under the provision of 3731 authorizing government appeals from orders dismissing an indictment as to any one or more counts, since the District Court's action constituted a dismissal of the numbers charge, and that there was no double jeopardy bar to a new trial, since the defendant had voluntarily terminated the proceedings on the numbers portion of the count by moving, in effect, to dismiss it (548 F2d 1).",lexis

"The present case is a sequel to Standard Oil Co. v Federal Trade Commission, 340 US 231, 95 L ed 239, 71 S Ct 240. The original proceeding was instituted by a complaint of the Federal Trade Commission challenging the right of the Standard Oil Company, under the Robinson-Patman Act, to sell gasoline to four comparatively large ""jobber"" customers at a lower price per gallon than it sold like gasoline to many comparatively small service station customers in the same area. The company defended on the ground, among others, that its lower price to the jobbers was justified under 2(b) of the Clayton Act, as amended by the Robinson-Patman Act (15 USC 13(b)), because made in good faith to meet a lawful and equally low price of a competitor. The Commission, with one member dissenting, ordered the company to cease and desist from making such a price differential (43 FTC 56).

The case was remanded with instructions that the Federal Trade Commission make findings on the company's contention that its discriminatory prices were made in good faith to meet an equally low price of a competitor. Upon remand the Commission found that the company did not act in good faith, and that the 2(b) defense was precluded because the company's reduced prices were made pursuant to a price system rather than being the result of departures from a nondiscriminatory price scale (49 FTC 923).

"A privately controlled organization composed of a group of physicians and scientists specializing in the treatment of diabetes conducted a study of the effectiveness of certain diabetes treatment regimens and received federal grants for its study from the National Institute of Arthritis, Metabolism and Digestive Diseases (NIAMDD), a federal agency which is one of several Institutes of the National Institutes of Health, which, in turn, is a component of the Public Health Service, which is itself a part of the Department of Health, Education and Welfare (HEW). Under pertinent federal regulations governing the grants, NIAMDD exercised some supervision over the study, such as by reviewing periodic reports and conducting on-site visits, but the day-to-day administration of the grant-supported activities was in the hands of the grantee. Additionally, although NIAMDD had a right of access to the data collected by the grantee pursuant to the grants and could obtain permanent custody of the grantee's data, NIAMDD neither exercised its right to review or to obtain custody of the data. Ultimately, the grantee's reports on the results of its study, indicating that the use of certain drugs for the treatment of diabetes increased the risk of heart disease, led to proceedings by the Secretary of HEW and by the Food and Drug Administration to control labeling and use of the drugs, and also prompted a national association of physicians who were critical of the grantee's study to request access to the raw data generated by the grantee in its study.

"A state prisoner whose conviction in a Maine court had been affirmed on appeal, and whose subsequent parole had been revoked, instituted an action in the Superior Court of Cumberland County, Maine, originally seeking to challenge the validity of his conviction, but subsequently electing to challenge only the procedure employed for revoking his parole, notwithstanding that the state court judge had warned that he considered the proceedings to be for postconviction relief, governed by a state statute under which grounds for such relief that are not asserted are deemed to be waived. The prisoner's attack on the parole revocation procedures was rejected by the Superior Court, and the decision was sustained on appeal by the Supreme Judicial Court of Maine (232 A2d 809). Thereafter, the Superior Court dismissed a subsequent petition for postconviction relief in which the prisoner sought to challenge the validity of his conviction on constitutional grounds, and on appeal, the Supreme Judicial Court of Maine held that the prisoner's failure to assert such claims in the earlier state proceedings constituted a waiver thereof under the postconviction relief statute (263 A2d 715). The prisoner then sought federal habeas corpus relief in the United States District Court for the District of Maine, challenging the constitutionality of his original conviction. After a full evidentiary hearing, the District Court found that the prisoner was at least of average intelligence, had been represented in the state courts by competent counsel, and had been fully aware of the possible consequences of failing to attack the validity of his conviction in the first state court proceeding. Thereupon the District Court denied relief on the grounds that (1) the prisoner had deliberately bypassed state procedures established for postconviction adjudication of the prisoner's claims, and (2) in any event, the prisoner's constitutional claims were without merit (330 F Supp 51). The Court of Appeals for the First Circuit reversed, holding that the prisoner had not waived his right to raise the constitutional issues, and that he was entitled to relief on one of the grounds asserted (458 F2d 626).",lexis

Saylor spoke to the driver, Joshua James Cooley, and observed that Cooley appeared to be non-native and had watery, bloodshot eyes. Saylor also noticed two semiautomatic rifles lying on Cooley‚Äôs front seat. Fearing violence, Saylor ordered Cooley out of the truck and conducted a patdown search.

"A black accused, who was charged in a state trial court in Missouri with a robbery that did not involve a gun, objected to the prosecutor's use of peremptory challenges to strike two black men from the jury panel. The prosecutor explained that he struck (1) the first juror because the juror had long unkempt hair, a mustache, and a beard; and (2) the second juror because (a) the juror had a mustache and a beard, and (b) the prosecutor feared that the juror, having had a gun pointed at him during a robbery, would believe that a robbery required a gun. The trial court overruled the objection, impaneled the jury, and convicted the accused of robbery. On direct appeal, the Missouri Court of Appeals (1) expressed the view that under the decision in Batson v Kentucky (1986) 476 US 79, 90 L Ed 2d 69, 106 S Ct 1712--that a state prosecutor's use of peremptory challenges to exclude blacks from a jury trying a black defendant may be the basis for a claim of purposeful discrimination in violation of the equal protection clause of the Federal Constitution's Fourteenth Amendment--the circumstances failed to raise the necessary inference of racial discrimination; and (2) affirmed the judgment of the trial court (747 SW2d 772). The accused filed in the United States District Court for the Eastern District of Missouri a petition for a writ of habeas corpus under 28 USCS 2254, asserting a Batson claim.

"Petitioner Ayestas was convicted of murder and sentenced to death in a Texas state court. He secured new counsel, but his conviction and sentence were affirmed on appeal.

His fourth set of attorneys did raise that failure in a federal habeas petition, but because the claim had never been raised in state court, the District Court held, it was barred by procedural default.

A navigational improvement project then in progress resulted in damage to valuable mineral deposits under the river, and the Cherokee Nation sought compensation from Congress, which (1) denied the claim on the ground that the Federal Government's navigational servitude rendered it meritless, but (2) allowed the Cherokees to seek judicial relief in the United States District Court for the Eastern District of Oklahoma. The Cherokee Nation filed a complaint alleging, among other things, that the navigation project had resulted in a taking, in violation of the Fifth Amendment, of their riverbed interests without just compensation. The District Court, granting the Cherokee Nation's motion for summary judgment, held that the Supreme Court's decision had given the Indian nations exclusive rights in the riverbed in question, and that the Federal Government had lost its navigational servitude by failing to expressly reserve it. The United States Court of Appeals for the Tenth Circuit affirmed, holding (1) that the United States retained its navigational servitude, but (2) that when the exercise of a navigational servitude affects private ownership rights not connected to a navigational use, the court must balance public and private interests to determine whether just compensation is due, and (3) that the Cherokee Nation was entitled to compensation under this test for any loss of property or diminution of value resulting from the navigation project (782 F2d 871).",lexis

"For each employee, pursuant to Subtitle C of the Internal Revenue Code (26 USCS 3101 et seq.), an employer has the responsibility of paying the employer's share of Social Security tax, and withholding from the employee's wages amounts for federal income tax and the employee's share of the Social Security tax. If the employer fails to pay over these items, then, under 6303(a) of the Code (26 USCS 6303(a)), within 60 days of making an assessment for such unpaid taxes, the Federal Government is required to provide the employer with notice of the assessment and a demand for payment. Elsewhere, 3505 of the Code (26 USCS 3505) provides that, in some instances, a person other than an employer--such as a lender--may be liable where (1) the third party directly or indirectly pays the employees' wages, and (2) Social Security and income taxes are not withheld from the wages of the employees and paid to the Federal Government.

Windstream responded by threatening to block all Sprint customer calls, which led Sprint to ask the Iowa Utilities Board (IU3) to enjoin Windstream from discontinuing service to Sprint. Windstream retracted its threat, and Sprint moved to withdraw its complaint. Concerned that the dispute would recur, the IU3 continued the proceedings in order to resolve the question whether VolP calls are subject to intrastate regulation.

"Two cases arose involving the validity, under the due process clause of the Federal Constitution's Fourteenth Amendment, of particular jury instructions defining ""reasonable doubt"" beyond which prosecutors must prove every element of a criminal offense. In one case, an individual--who had allegedly shot two men to death, killed a man who gave information on the shooting to police, and killed the man's wife--was tried in a California court on four counts of first-degree murder. In instructing the jury on the prosecution's burden of proof, the trial court defined reasonable doubt in part as (1) ""not a mere possible doubt,"" since ""everything relating to human affairs, and depending on moral evidence, is open to some possible or imaginary doubt""; and (2) that state of the case which leaves the jurors, after considering all the evidence, unable to say that ""they feel an abiding conviction, to a moral certainty, of the truth of the charge."" The individual was convicted, sentenced to death on one count, and sentenced to life imprisonment without possibility of parole on the other counts. The Supreme Court of California, in affirming the convictions and sentences, rejected a claim that the reasonable doubt instruction--particularly the references to ""possible doubt,"" ""moral evidence,"" and ""moral certainty""--violated the due process clause (4 Cal 4th 155, 14 Cal Rptr 2d 342, 841 P2d 862). In the second case, a man who had allegedly killed an elderly woman by beating her and cutting her throat was tried in a Nebraska court. The court's instructions (1) defined reasonable doubt, in part, as (a) that which would cause a reasonable and prudent person, in an important transaction of life, to hesitate before taking the represented facts as true, (b) that which would not permit the jurors, after full and fair consideration of all the evidence, ""to have an abiding conviction, to a moral certainty,"" of the accused's guilt, and (c) ""an actual and substantial doubt,"" arising from the evidence or lack thereof rather than ""from mere possibility, from bare imagination, or from fanciful conjecture""; and (2) stated that the jury could ""find an accused guilty upon the strong probabilities of the case,"" if such probabilities were ""strong enough to exclude any doubt of his guilt that is reasonable."" The man was convicted of first-degree murder and sentenced to death, and this judgment was affirmed on appeal. On postconviction review, the Supreme Court of Nebraska rejected a claim that the reasonable doubt instruction--particularly the references to ""moral certainty,"" ""substantial doubt,"" and ""strong probabilities""--violated the due process clause (242 Neb 306, 494 NW2d 565).",lexis

Applying a provision of the Juvenile Delinquency Act (18 USCS 5037(c)(1)(B)) which required the length of official detention in certain circumstances to be limited to ""the maximum term of imprisonment that would be authorized if the juvenile had been tried and convicted as an adult,"" the District Court committed the juvenile to official detention for 3 years, that being the maximum sentence for involuntary manslaughter under 18 USCS 1112(b).

The plaintiffs filed a class action against state officials in the United States District Court for the Middle District of Florida, alleging that the state statute violated the equal protection clause of the Fourteenth Amendment by discriminating against school children of property-poor counties, in which 10 mills of ad valorem tax would produce fewer dollars per child for educational purposes than would 10 mills of ad valorem in other counties.

Pursuant to the City's charter, the referendum petition stayed the site plan's implementation until its approval by the voters. An Ohio court denied respondents an injunction against the petition, and the city engineer, on advice from the city law director, denied their request for building permits. The voters eventually passed the referendum, thus repealing the ordinance. Subsequently, the Ohio Supreme Court declared the referendum invalid under Ohio's Constitution, the City issued the building permits, and construction commenced.

After the Ohio Supreme Court invalidated the referendum, thus reducing the federal action to a claim for damages for the construction delay, the District Court granted the City and its officials summary judgment. In reversing, the Sixth Circuit found that respondents had produced sufficient evidence to go to trial on the allegation that the City, by allowing the petition to stay the site plan's implementation, gave effect to the racial bias reflected in the public's opposition to the project; that respondents had stated a valid Fair Housing Act claim because the City's actions had a disparate impact based on race and family status; and that a genuine issue of material fact existed as to whether the City had engaged in arbitrary and irrational government conduct in violation of substantive due process.",lexis

In seeking the injunction, the former judge claimed that (1) he had been coerced into giving the grand jury testimony by the concerted action of an assistant attorney general of the state and members of the New Jersey Supreme Court when the members of the court had met with the former judge shortly before he appeared before the state grand jury and had interrogated him with regard to the subject matter of the grand jury investigation and the propriety of a municipal judge invoking the privilege against compulsory self-incrimination, and (2) the significant role played by members of the New Jersey Supreme Court made it impossible for the former judge to receive a fair trial in the New Jersey state court system. The District Court dismissed the complaint on the ground that federal intervention was precluded under the rule that a federal court must not intervene by way of either injunction or declaratory judgment in a pending state criminal prosecution in the absence of exceptional circumstances creating a threat of irreparable injury both great and immediate. The United States Court of Appeals for the Third Circuit, although holding that a permanent injunction against the state prosecution would be inappropriate, nevertheless reversed the District Court's order of dismissal and remanded the case for an evidentiary hearing on the former judge's charge of coercion and for the entry of a declaratory judgment on the question whether the former judge's grand jury testimony should be admitted in evidence at his state trial--the Court of Appeals concluding that such procedure would free the state courts from even the appearance of partiality (500 F2d 1188).",lexis

"Two cases involved issues as to what might be considered ""testimonial statements"" for such purposes. The first case was also from the state of Washington and concerned a state criminal defendant's trial on a charge of felony violation of a domestic no-contact order. Over the defendant's objection, there was admitted into evidence a tape recording of some pretrial statements made by a woman (who did not appear at trial) to a ""911"" emergency operator during a 911 call, including a portion in which the woman identified the defendant (her former boyfriend) as her assailant. A jury convicted the defendant. The Washington Court of Appeals affirmed (116 Wn. App. 81, 64 P. 3d 661). The Supreme Court of Washington, in affirming, concluded that the portion of the 911 conversation with the identifying statements was not testimonial for confrontation-clause purposes (154 Wn. 2d 291, 111 P. 3d 844).  [**225]  The second case was from Indiana and involved a state criminal defendant's bench trial on charges of domestic battery and violating his probation. Over defense counsel's objection, there were admitted into evidence a police officer's testimony, and an affidavit by the defendant's wife, concerning some pretrial statements by the wife (who did not appear at trial) to the officer at the asserted crime scene, the couple's home, after the police had responded to a reported domestic disturbance, where--after the wife had answered the officer's questions--he had had her execute the affidavit. The trial judge found the defendant guilty on both charges. The Indiana Court of Appeals affirmed in relevant part (809 N.E.2d 945). The Supreme Court of Indiana, in affirming, expressed the view that for confrontation-clause purposes, (1) the wife's oral statements were not testimonial; and (2) although the affidavit was testimonial and thus had been wrongly admitted, the admission was harmless beyond a reasonable doubt (829 N.E.2d 444).",lexis

On the basis of the respondent's own testimony that she had left the United States for Thailand during January 1974 and that she had improperly obtained a nonimmigrant visa from the United States consular officer in Thailand to aid her re-entry 3 months later, an Immigration Judge concluded that respondent had failed to meet the 7-year ""continuous physical presence"" requirement of 244(a)(1) and accordingly denied her application for suspension. The Board of Immigration Appeals affirmed, holding that the respondent's absence was meaningfully interruptive of her continuous physical presence in the United States because she was illegally in the United States at the time she left for Thailand and that she was able to return only by misrepresenting her status as the wife of a foreign student. On appeal, the United States Court of Appeals for the Ninth Circuit reversed, holding that the Board of Immigration Appeals had placed too much emphasis on respondent's illegal presence prior to her departure and on the increased risk of deportation that her departure had engendered, and that since the Board of Immigration Appeals had failed to view the circumstances in their totality and analyzed those circumstances in light of the underlying congressional purpose, the case would be remanded for further proceedings on the ""continuous physical presence"" issue (673 F2d 1013).",lexis

Also, an Illinois statute provides that new political parties may not bear the same name as any established party. A group of citizens sought (1) to expand the Harold Washington Party (HWP), which was already an established party in the city of Chicago, throughout Cook County--which was divided into one Chicago city district and one suburban district, each of which was large enough to require 25,000 signatures on new-party nominating petitions--and (2) to run candidates for at-large, city-district, and suburban-district county board seats in 1990. The citizens gathered 44,000 signatures from the city district, but only 7,800 signatures from the suburban district. Interested voters filed objections to the HWP petitions with the county electoral board, but the electoral board ruled that (1) the citizens were not barred from running for county offices under the HWP name because of the fact that a party of the same name already existed in the city, especially since the most recent HWP mayoral candidate had authorized the county candidates to use the party name; (2) the failure to collect 25,000 signatures from the suburban district disqualified the HWP from running candidates for suburban-district county board seats, but not for city-district and at-large seats; and (3) the HWP's failure to designate candidates for county judicial offices did not disqualify the entire HWP slate for county offices. The Circuit Court of Cook County, Illinois (1) affirmed the electoral board's ruling as to use of the HWP name, but (2) held that either the lack of sufficient signatures in the suburban district or the failure to designate judicial candidates was sufficient grounds to disqualify the entire HWP slate of candidates.

"Arkansas imposed a tax on receipts from the sale of all tangible personal property and of a broad range of specified services. The tax statute expressly exempted receipts from subscription and over-the-counter newspaper sales and subscription magazine sales.

The tax affected approximately 100 cable television operators that offered a wide variety of programming--a mixture of news, information, and entertainment--throughout the state. A cable television subscriber, along with a cable television operator and a trade organization of Arkansas cable operators, brought a class action in the Arkansas Chancery Court against the Arkansas commissioner of revenues and other state and local officials, in which action it was argued that the imposition of the sales tax on cable services, and the exemption or exclusion of newspapers, magazines, and satellite television broadcast services, violated the plaintiff taxpayers' rights under the Federal Constitution's First Amendment and the equal protection clause of the Federal Constitution's Fourteenth Amendment. The Chancery Court, although initially granting the taxpayers' motion for a preliminary injunction, ultimately upheld the constitutionality of the sales tax as applied to cable television services, and dissolved the preliminary injunction. In 1989, shortly after the Chancery Court issued its decision, Arkansas again amended the tax statute so as to extend the sales tax to satellite television broadcast services provided to home dish-antennae owners. On appeal to the Supreme Court of Arkansas, the taxpayers argued that the sales tax statute, as so amended, continued to discriminate unconstitutionally against cable television services. The Supreme Court of Arkansas, reversing and remanding, (1) held that the First Amendment (a) does not prohibit the differential taxation of different media, but (b) prohibits discriminatory taxation among members of the same medium; (2) found that cable television services and satellite broadcast services to home dish-antennae owners were substantially the same medium; (3) held that the sales tax violated the First Amendment for the period during which cable services but not satellite broadcast services were subject to the tax; and (4) held that the illegality of the tax under the First Amendment was cured by the application of the tax to satellite broadcast services (301 Ark 483, 785 SW2d 202).

"In April 2006, a stray 9-millimeter bullet killed a 2-year-old child after a street fight in the Bronx. Eyewitnesses described the shooter as wearing a blue shirt or sweater. Police officers determined Ronnell Gilliam was involved and that Nicholas Morris had been at the scene. A search of Morris‚Äô apartment revealed a 9-millimeter cartridge and three .357- caliber bullets. Gilliam initially identified Morris as the shooter, but he subsequently said that Darrell Hemphill, Gilliam‚Äôs cousin, was the shooter. Not crediting Gilliam‚Äôs recantation, the State charged Morris with the child‚Äôs murder and possession of a 9-millimeter handgun. In a subsequent plea deal, the State agreed to dismiss the murder charges against Morris if he pleaded guilty to a new charge of possession of a .357 revolver, a weapon that had not killed the victim. Years later, the State indicted Hemphill for the child‚Äôs murder after learning that Hemphill‚Äôs DNA matched a blue sweater found in Gilliam‚Äôs apartment shortly after the murder. At his trial, Hemphill elicited undisputed testimony from a prosecution witness that police had recovered 9-millimeter ammunition from Morris‚Äô apartment, thus pointing to Morris as the culprit. Morris was not available to testify at Hemphill‚Äôs trial because he was outside the United States. Relying on People v. Reid, 19 N. Y. 3d 382, 388, 971 N.

The court reasoned that although Morris‚Äô out-of-court statements had not been subjected to cross-examination, Hemphill‚Äôs arguments and evidence had ‚Äúopened the door‚Äù and admission of the statements was reasonably necessary to correct the misleading impression Hemphill had created.

"After an individual accused of capital murder was formally charged, but before counsel was appointed to represent him, a Texas District Court granted the prosecutor's motion for a psychiatric examination to determine, among other things, the accused's future dangerousness. Copies of that motion and order were placed in the court file but were never served on the accused. After the accused was indicted and arraigned and defense counsel had been appointed, the prosecution, without notifying defense counsel, moved for another psychiatric examination, and the District Court, without determining whether defense counsel had been notified, ordered the accused's examination by the psychologist who had previously examined him and by a psychiatrist. Subsequently, a different psychiatrist notified the District Court that he had examined the accused pursuant to its order and found him to have a severe antisocial personality disorder and to be likely to commit future acts of violence. The accused was tried and convicted of capital murder, and a separate sentencing hearing was held at which the second psychiatrist, over defense objections, was allowed to testify that in his opinion the accused represented a continuing threat to society, rated a ""ten plus"" on a sociopathic scale of one to ten, and was beyond the reach of psychiatric rehabilitation. The sentencing jury, instructed that it had to decide whether the prosecution had proved beyond a reasonable doubt (1) that the conduct of the accused causing the death had been committed deliberately and with the reasonable expectation that the death of the victim would result and (2) that the accused would probably commit further criminal acts of violence constituting a continuing threat to society, answered both questions in the affirmative, and the District Court sentenced the accused to death. In affirming the accused's conviction and sentence, the Texas Court of Criminal Appeals (1) ruled that the admission of the second psychiatrist's testimony violated the accused's Sixth Amendment right to assistance of counsel, but (2) ruled that Sixth Amendment violations relating only to the admission of particular evidence are not per se grounds for reversal, and (3) found that the error was harmless in this case, since other properly admitted evidence of the accused's bad character and future dangerousness--including testimony by the psychologist--would have led an average jury to the same conclusions (726 SW2d 81).",lexis

However, the Coast Guard--indicating that, for Coast Guard purposes, the barge was, under 46 USCS 2101(43), an ""uninspected vessel"" that was subject to minimal Coast Guard regulation, rather than, under 46 USCS 3301, an ""inspected vessel"" that was subject to comprehensive Coast Guard regulation--did not accuse the company of violating any Coast Guard regulations. Subsequently, the Occupational Health and Safety Administration (OSHA) cited the company for three violations of the Occupational Safety and Health Act, as amended (Act) (29 USCS 651 et seq.). The company challenged OSHA's jurisdiction to issue the citation on the grounds that (1) OSHA's jurisdiction allegedly was pre-empted under 4(b)(1) of the Act (29 USCS 653(b)), which provided that nothing in the Act applied to working conditions of employees with respect to which other federal agencies exercised statutory authority to prescribe or enforce standards or regulations affecting occupational safety and health; and (2) the barge allegedly was not a ""workplace"" under 4(a) of the Act (29 USCS 653(a)), which described the geographic areas, such as a state, in which workplaces were covered under the Act.",lexis
"A former version of a California public records statute generally required a state or local law enforcement agency to make public the name, address, and occupation of every individual arrested by the agency. In 1996, the statute was amended to require that a person requesting an arrestee's address declare, under penalty of perjury, that (1) the request was being made for journalistic, scholarly, political, governmental, or investigative purposes, and (2) the address would not be used directly or indirectly to sell a product or service. A private publishing service had obtained names and addresses of recently arrested individuals from law enforcement agencies under the statute's former version and had provided such information to customers such as attorneys, insurance companies, drug and alcohol counselors, and driving schools. However, on the effective date of the statutory amendment, various law enforcement agencies denied the publishing service access to the address information, allegedly because the service's employees did not sign declarations pursuant to the amended statute. The publishing service, which had previously filed suit in the United States District Court for the Southern District of California against various state officials and local agencies for declaratory and injunctive relief pursuant to 42 USCS 1983--on the theory that the amended statute violated the Federal Constitution's First and Fourteenth Amendments--amended the complaint and sought a temporary restraining order. The District Court issued such an order and subsequently issued a preliminary injunction. Ultimately, the District Court--stating that the case at hand presented a facial challenge to the amended statute--granted the service's motion for summary judgment, on the ground that the amended statute was an impermissible restriction on commercial speech and thus violated the First Amendment (946 F Supp 822). The United States Court of Appeals for the Ninth Circuit, in affirming, expressed the view that (1) the amended statute restricted commercial speech, which was entitled to a limited measure of First Amendment protection; and (2) although an asserted governmental interest in protecting arrestees' privacy was substantial, the amended statute's numerous exceptions precluded the statute from directly and materially advancing such an interest (146 F3d 1133).",lexis
"Under the California penal code, an accused has an absolute right to a preliminary hearing before a neutral magistrate. The accused has the right to appear personally at the hearing, to be represented by counsel, to cross-examine hostile witnesses, to present exculpatory evidence, and to exclude illegally obtained evidence. If the magistrate determines that probable cause exists, the accused is bound over for trial. A nurse was charged by the state of California with murdering 12 patients by administering massive doses of a heart drug. A preliminary hearing commenced, and the accused moved to exclude the public under a California statute requiring such proceedings to be open unless exclusion of the public is necessary in order to protect the accused's right to a fair and impartial trial. The magistrate granted the motion, finding that closure was necessary because the case had attracted national publicity and that the media might report only one side of the case. At the conclusion of the 41-day hearing, a newspaper publisher asked that the transcript of the proceedings be released, but the magistrate refused and sealed the record. The state, later joined by the publisher, moved in California Superior Court to have the transcript released to the public, but the court, finding that there was a reasonable likelihood that release might prejudice the accused's right to a fair and impartial trial, ordered that the transcript remain sealed. The publisher then filed a peremptory writ of mandate with the California Court of Appeal, which ultimately denied the writ. Meanwhile, the accused waived his right to a jury trial and the Superior Court released the transcript. The California Supreme Court then denied the publisher's peremptory writ of mandate, holding (1) that there is no general First Amendment right of access to preliminary hearings, and (2) that under the California access statute, if the accused establishes a ""reasonable likelihood of substantial prejudice,"" the burden shifts to the state or the media to show by a preponderance of the evidence that there is no such reasonable probability of prejudice (37 Cal 3d 772, 691 P2d 1026).",lexis

"The Oregon Death With Dignity Act (ODWDA), which was enacted in 1994, exempts from civil or criminal liability state-licensed physicians who, in compliance with ODWDA's specific safeguards, dispense or prescribe a lethal dose of drugs requested by an Oregon resident with a terminal illness that, within reasonable medical judgment, will cause death within 6 months. In 2001, the Attorney General issued an interpretive rule announcing that (1) assisting suicide is not a legitimate medical purpose under _ 1306.04(a); (2) prescribing, dispensing, or administering federally controlled substances for this purpose violates the CSA; and (3) such conduct by a registered physician may render the physician's registration inconsistent with the public interest and therefore subject to possible suspension or revocation under _ 824(a)(4). Oregon and some state residents--a physician, a pharmacist, and some terminally-ill patients--challenged the interpretive rule, and the United States District Court for the District of Oregon permanently enjoined the rule's enforcement. The United States Court of Appeals for the Ninth Circuit then held the rule invalid, as the Court of Appeals reasoned that (1) the rule altered the balance between the states and the Federal Government without the requisite clear statement that the CSA authorized such alteration; and (2) in the alternative, the rule could not be squared with the CSA's plain language, which (a) targeted only conventional drug abuse, and (b) excluded the Attorney General from decisions on medical policy ( 368 F. 3d 1118).",lexis

The Superior Court denied injunctive relief against the operation of the desegregation plan, but the Georgia Supreme Court reversed (226 Ga 456, 175 SE2d 649), holding that (1) in attempting to achieve a predetermined racial balance in the elementary schools by treating students differently because of their race, the county school board violated the equal protection clause of the Fourteenth Amendment, and (2) the plan violated federal civil rights legislation pertaining to the assignment of students to overcome racial imbalance (42 USC 2000c(b)) and the transportation of students to achieve racial balance (42 USC 2000c- 6(a)).",lexis
"Under New York constitutional and statutory provisions, a new county charter, changing the allocation of powers between the county and its cities, towns, and villages, can go into effect only if it is approved in a referendum election by separate majorities of the voters who live in the cities within the county, and of those who live outside the cities. In 1972, a proposed charter for Niagara County, New York, was put to referendum, with a majority of the city voters approving the charter and a majority of the noncity voters disapproving it. A majority of those voting in the entire county favored the charter. A group of Niagara County voters filed suit pursuant to 42 USCS 1983 in the United States District Court for the Western District of New York, seeking a declaration that the New York concurrent majority requirement was unconstitutional, and an order directing the appropriate New York officials to file the Niagara County charter as a duly enacted local law. A three-judge court was convened, but before its decision was announced, another new charter was put to a referendum in Niagara County in 1974. Again a majority of the city voters approved the charter, a majority of the noncity voters disapproved it, and an aggregate majority of all those in the county who voted approved it. The District Court subsequently found the concurrent majority requirement violative of the equal protection clause of the Fourteenth Amendment, and ordered implementation of the 1972 charter (386 F Supp 1). On appeal, the United States Supreme Court vacated that judgment and remanded the cause for reconsideration in light of the provisions of the new charter adopted by Niagara County in 1974 (423 US 808, 46 L Ed 2d 24, 96 S Ct 11). On remand, the District Court found that there was no substantial difference between the two county charters and that the 1974 charter superseded the 1972 charter. Pursuant to its previous constitutional adjudication, the District Court decreed that the 1974 charter was in full force and effect.",lexis
"An Indiana stock insurance corporation, as required by North Carolina law to do business in the state, joined the North Carolina Life and Accident and Health Insurance Guaranty Association, a state-created association of all foreign and domestic insurance companies operating in North Carolina which was ultimately responsible for fulfilling the policy obligations of any member that becomes insolvent or otherwise fails to honor its obligation to North Carolina policyholders. After determining that the insurance company's financial condition was questionable, the North Carolina Commissioner of Insurance required it to post a $ 100,000 deposit for the sole benefit of North Carolina policyholders, and the company did so soon thereafter. Subsequently, the Indiana Department of Insurance commenced rehabilitation proceedings against the insurance company in the Superior Court for Marion County, on the ground that its reserves were inadequate to meet its future policy obligations. The rehabilitation court appointed the Indiana Commissioner of Insurance as rehabilitator and directed him to take possession of the business and assets of the insurance company, and notice of this action was sent to all state insurance commissioners. The North Carolina Commissioner informed the Association that the company was undergoing rehabilitation in Indiana, and that title to all assets of the company had been transferred, and the Association later intervened in the rehabilitation proceedings. After extensive proceedings, the rehabilitation court ordered the adoption of a rehabilitation plan, the court stating that it had jurisdiction over the subject matter and over the parties, including all policyowners and state insurance guaranty associations, and no appeal was taken from this order. Afterwards, the insurance company and the the Association disagreed as to the effect of the plan on the deposit previously made in North Carolina, and the Association filed suit against the insurance company, and various North Carolina officials, in the Superior Court of Wake County, North Carolina, seeking a declaratory judgment that the Association was entitled to use the deposit to fulfill the pre-rehabilitation contractual obligations to North Carolina policyowners that had been compromised in the rehabilitation proceeding. The insurance company answered, asserting that the Indiana judgment was res judicata as to any pre-rehabilitation claims against the deposit, and therefore was entitled to full faith and credit in the North Carolina courts. In addition, the insurance company invoked the rehabilitation court's continuing jurisdiction to resolve all the questions involving the interpretation of the plan, and after a hearing at which the company and the Association appeared and presented their respective full-faith-and-credit claims, the rehabilitation court held that the plan fully adjudicated and determined that the North Carolina deposit was an asset of the insurance company, and any claim existing as of the date of the adoption of the plan was compromised, settled, and dismissed by its final order and the plan. However, on motions for summary judgment filed by both parties, the North Carolina trial court ruled in favor of the Association, reasoning that it was the only court with a requisite subject matter jurisdiction to determine the rights of North Carolina policyholders in the deposit, and noting that the Indiana courts did not have in personam jurisdiction over North Carolina officials or over the North Carolina policyholders, and the court ordered the liquidation of the deposit to reimburse the Association for satisfying the pre-rehabilitation claims of North Carolina policyholders. On appeal, the Court of Appeals of North Carolina affirmed, concluding that the deposit could never be an asset of the insurance company, and that the rehabilitation court's decision to the contrary was not entitled to full faith and credit (48 NC App 508, 269 SE2d 688), and the Supreme Court of North Carolina declined to grant discretionary review (301 NC 527, 273 SE2d 453).",lexis
"Two privately retained lawyers represented three criminal defendants charged with first degree murder throughout the state proceedings which followed their indictment in Pennsylvania. All the defendants were tried separately. The first defendant to come to trial was found guilty in the Pennsylvania Court of Common Pleas wholly on the basis of circumstantial evidence after his defense rested without presenting any evidence. At no time did such defendant or his lawyers object to the multiple representation. The other two codefendants were subsequently acquitted. The first defendant eventually petitioned for collateral relief under state law, alleging, among other claims, that he had been denied the effective assistance of counsel because his defense lawyers represented conflicting interests. After hearing testimony from both lawyers--one of whom testified that concern for the other two codefendants had influenced his judgment not to present a defense--the Court of Common Pleas denied relief. The Supreme Court of Pennsylvania affirmed both the first defendant's original conviction and the denial of collateral relief (472 Pa 129, 371 A2d 468). The court ruled that there was no dual representation ""in the true sense of the term,"" and that resting the defense was a reasonable tactic which did not amount to a denial of the effective assistance of counsel. The defendant then sought habeas corpus relief in the United States District Court for the Eastern District of Pennsylvania, which accepted the Supreme Court of Pennsylvania's conclusion that there had been no multiple representation. The District Court also decided that, even assuming multiple representation, the evidence adduced in the state post-conviction proceeding revealed no conflict of interest. The United States Court of Appeals for the Third Circuit reversed, holding that the two lawyers' participation in the trial of the defendants established multiple representation as a matter of law, and further ruling that a sufficient possibility of conflict of interest had been raised to prove a violation of the defendant's Sixth Amendment right to the effective assistance of counsel, since a defendant was entitled to reversal of a conviction whenever some showing of a possible conflict of interest or prejudice, however remote, was made (593 F2d 512).",lexis

"Charitable organizations soliciting funds in California must disclose the identities of their major donors to the state Attorney General‚Äôs Office. Charities generally must register with the Attorney General and renew their registrations annually. The Attorney General requires charities renewing their registrations to file copies of their Internal Revenue Service Form 990, a form on which tax-exempt organizations provide information about their mission, leadership, and finances. Schedule B to Form 990‚Äîthe document that gives rise to the present dispute‚Äîrequires organizations to disclose the names and addresses of their major donors. The State contends that having this information readily available furthers its interest in policing misconduct by charities. The petitioners are two tax-exempt charities that solicit contributions in California. Since 2001, each petitioner has renewed its registration and has filed a copy of its Form 990 with the Attorney General, as required by Cal. Code Regs., tit. 11, ¬ß301. To preserve their donors‚Äô anonymity, however, the petitioners have declined to file unredacted Schedule Bs, and they had until recently faced no consequences for noncompliance. In 2010, the State increased its enforcement of charities‚Äô Schedule B disclosure obligations, and the Attorney General ultimately threatened the petitioners with suspension of their registrations and fines for noncompliance. The petitioners each responded by filing suit in District Court, alleging that the compelled disclosure requirement violated their First Amendment rights and the rights of their donors. Disclosure of their Schedule Bs, the petitioners alleged, would make their donors less likely to contribute and would subject them to the risk of reprisals. Both organizations challenged the constitutionality of the disclosure requirement on its face and as applied to them. In each case, the District Court granted preliminary injunctive relief prohibiting the Attorney General from collecting the petitioners‚Äô Schedule B information. The Ninth Circuit vacated and remanded, reasoning that Circuit precedent required rejection of the petitioners‚Äô facial challenge. Reviewing the petitioners‚Äô as-applied claims under an ‚Äúexacting scrutiny‚Äù standard, the panel narrowed the District Court‚Äôs injunction, and it allowed the Attorney General to collect the petitioners‚Äô Schedule Bs so long as they were not publicly disclosed. On remand, the District Court held bench trials in both cases, after which it entered judgment for the petitioners and permanently enjoined the Attorney General from collecting their Schedule Bs. Applying exacting scrutiny, the District Court held that disclosure of Schedule Bs was not narrowly tailored to the State‚Äôs interest in investigating charitable misconduct. The court found little evidence that the Attorney General‚Äôs investigators relied on Schedule Bs to detect charitable fraud, and it determined that the disclosure regime burdened the associational rights of donors. The District Court also found that California was unable to ensure the confidentiality of donors‚Äô information. The Ninth Circuit again vacated the District Court‚Äôs injunctions, and this time reversed the judgments and remanded for entry of judgment in favor of the Attorney General. The Ninth Circuit held that the District Court had erred by imposing a narrow tailoring requirement. And it reasoned that the disclosure regime satisfied exacting scrutiny because the up-front collection of charities‚Äô Schedule Bs promoted investigative efficiency and effectiveness. The panel also found that the disclosure of Schedule Bs would not meaningfully burden donors‚Äô associational rights. The Ninth Circuit denied rehearing en banc, over a dissent.",lexis

"California‚Äôs prisons are designed to house a population just under 80,000, but at the time of the decision under review the population was almost double that. The resulting conditions are the subject of two federal class actions. In Coleman v.

A Special Master appointed to oversee remedial efforts reported 12 years later that the state of mental health care in California‚Äôs prisons was deteriorating due to increased overcrowding. In Plata v. Brown, filed in 2001, the State conceded that deficiencies in prison medical care violated prisoners‚Äô Eighth Amendment rights and stipulated to a remedial injunction. But when the State had not complied with the injunction by 2005, the court appointed a Receiver to oversee remedial efforts. Three years later, the Receiver described continuing deficiencies caused by overcrowding. Believing that a remedy for unconstitutional medical and mental health care could not be achieved without reducing overcrowding, the Coleman and Plata plaintiffs moved their respective District Courts to convene a three-judge court empowered by the Prison Litigation Reform Act of 1995 (PLRA) to order reductions in the prison population. The judges in both actions granted the request, and the cases were consolidated before a single three-judge court. After hearing testimony and making extensive findings of fact, the court ordered California to reduce its prison population to 137.5% of design capacity within two years.

"After attorneys in the Antitrust Division of the Department of Justice conducted an extensive grand jury investigation of three American corporations suspected of conspiring to fix the price of goods being sold to a foreign government and financed by the Department of State's Agency for International Development, the Department of Justice concluded that while the corporations had violated 1 of the Sherman Act (15 USCS 1), criminal prosecution was not warranted, and the jury was discharged without returning any indictments. Subsequently, the attorneys who had been in charge of the grand jury investigation began a civil investigation of the alleged price fixing. During the course of this investigation, Civil Investigative Demands (CIDs) were served on the corporations, as well as other persons and entities, requesting the production of various documents. Compliance with the CIDs could be achieved by certifying that the requested materials had already been furnished to the grand jury which investigated the price-fixing charges. Two of the corporations refused to comply with the CIDs and otherwise refused to produce requested documents. Nevertheless, the Antitrust Division attorneys came to the tentative conclusion that the businesses had violated the False Claims Act (31 USCS 3729-3731) and the Foreign Assistance Act (22 USCS 2151-2429) as well as the Sherman Act. However, because the Civil Division of the Department of Justice has primary responsibility for enforcing the False Claims Act, the Antitrust Division attorneys deemed it appropriate to consult with Civil Division attorneys before initiating a civil action. Also, due to the venue of the contemplated civil action, it was felt to be necessary to consult with the United States Attorney for the Southern District of New York. Accordingly, the Antitrust Division attorneys requested, under Rule 6(e) of the Federal Rules of Criminal Procedure, an order allowing them to disclose the grand jury materials from the price-fixing investigation to various named Government attorneys and their associates. Rule 6(e) prohibits the disclosure of grand jury materials except as prescribed in that rule. The United States District Court for the Southern District of New York granted the request, finding that the Government's interest in coordinating fair and efficient enforcement of the False Claims Act and in obtaining the Civil Division's and the United States Attorney's expert consultation constituted a ""particularized need"" for such disclosure pursuant to the considerations described in case law interpreting the requirements of Rule 6(e). After the corporations had been advised of the the Rule 6(e) order and of the impending civil action against them, they moved to vacate the Rule 6(e) order and to oin the Government from using the grand jury information in the civil action. The District Court denied both forms of relief, and the corporations appealed to the United States Court of Appeals for the Second Circuit, requesting immediate interim relief as well. The Court of Appeals granted partial relief, allowing the Government to file a complaint, but ordering it to be filed under seal. After expedited consideration, the Court of Appeals, reversing both aspects of the District Court's order, concluded (1) that because the Antitrust Division attorneys who had worked on the grand jury investigation were now involved only in civil proceedings, they were forbidden from making continued use of the grand jury information without first obtaining a court order under Rule 6(e), and (2) that disclosure of the grand jury materials to previously uninvolved attorneys for consultation purposes had not been supported by an adequate showing of particularized need because the same information eventually could have been obtained through civil discovery; nevertheless, the Court of Appeals, holding that the complaint which had been filed by the Government disclosed nothing about the grand jury investigation, took no action with respect to the Government's complaint (774 F2d 34).",lexis

Specifically, the District Court declared unconstitutional a section specifying procedures for the election of employee bargaining representatives, a provision limiting union publicity directed at consumers of agricultural products, and the statute's criminal penalty provision. The District Court also found unconstitutional a section excusing an employer from furnishing to a labor organization certain information and aid to enable it to communicate with the employer's employees (i.e., an access provision), and struck down a provision construed by the court as mandating compulsory arbitration of labor disputes (449 F Supp 449).",lexis

Section 203(b) of the interim regulations ( 20 CFR 727.203(b)) provides that all relevant medical evidence shall be considered in the adjudication of a claim, and that the interim presumption is rebutted if the evidence establishes certain conclusions.

The Tax Court judge issued the Tax Court's decision, holding the taxpayers liable for underpaid taxes and for fraud penalties.

"In the Superior Court of Suffolk County, Massachusetts, an accused and a codefendant were tried before a jury on charges arising out of a shooting. There were three charges against the accused, two alleging assault and a third alleging unlawful possession of a firearm. At the conclusion of the prosecution's case, the accused moved, under a Massachusetts rule of criminal procedure, for a required finding of not guilty on the firearm charge. At sidebar and after hearing argument from the prosecutor, the trial judge granted the motion, reasoning that there was ""not a scintilla of evidence"" that the accused had possessed a weapon with--as Massachusetts law then required for the offense's ""firearm"" element--a barrel length of less than 16 inches. The accused's motion was marked with a handwritten endorsement ""Filed and after hearing, Allowed,"" and the motion's allowance was entered on the docket, but the trial judge did not notify the jury of this ruling. Later, after the defense case had proceeded and the defense had rested, the prosecutor brought to the trial judge's attention a Massachusetts precedent under which, the prosecutor contended, the alleged victim's testimony, during the prosecution's case, about the kind of gun assertedly used sufficed to establish that the barrel was shorter than 16 inches. The trial judge announced orally that she was ""reversing"" her previous ruling and allowing the firearm charge to go to the jury. Corresponding notations were made on the original of the accused's motion and on the docket. The jury then convicted the accused on all three charges. Subsequently, the accused received a sentence of imprisonment.",lexis

"American nationals may seek money damages from state sponsors of terrorism in the courts of the United States. See 28 U. S. C. ¬ß 1605A. Prevailing plaintiffs, however, often face practical and legal diffculties enforcing their judgments. To place beyond dispute the availability of certain assets for satisfaction of judgments rendered in terrorism cases against Iran, Congress enacted the Iran Threat Reduction and Syria Human Rights Act of 2012.

Respondents-more than 1,000 victims of Iran-sponsored acts of terrorism, their estate representatives, and surviving family members-rank within 16 discrete groups, each of which brought suit against Iran. To enforce judgments they obtained by default, the 16 groups moved for turnover of about $1.75 billion in bond assets held in a New York bank account-assets that, respondents alleged, were owned by Bank Markazi, the Central Bank of Iran. The turnover proceeding began in 2008. In 2012, the judgment holders updated their motions to include execution claims under ¬ß8772. Bank Markazi maintained that ¬ß8772 could not withstand inspection under the separation-of-powers doctrine, contending that Congress had usurped the judicial role by directing a particular result in the pending enforcement proceeding.

"A credit company loaned money to a clothing manufacturer and obtained a security interest in the manufacturer's inventory. After the manufacturer ran into financial difficulties and ceased operations, the credit company took possession of the inventory, including items which had been manufactured during the last few weeks of the manufacturer's operations, for which the manufacturer's employees had not been paid. The United States Department of Labor, determining that items manufactured during the period for which the employees had not been paid (1) had been produced in violation of the minimum wage and overtime requirements of 6 and 7 of the Fair Labor Standards Act (FLSA) (29 USCS 206, 207) and thus (2) were barred from introduction into interstate commerce under the ""hot goods"" provision of 15(a)(1) of the FLSA (29 USCS 215(a)(1)), filed two separate actions in which the Department sought to enjoin the credit company from shipping those items in interstate commerce.

"An Ohio state court, declaring that an insurance company was insolvent, directed that the company be liquidated. The Ohio superintendent of insurance was appointed to serve as liquidator. In the ensuing liquidation proceedings, the United States--which filed claims in excess of $ 10.7 million as an obligee on various immigration, appearance, performance, and payment bonds issued by the company as surety--asserted that those claims were entitled to first priority under 31 USCS 3713(a)(1)(A)(iii), which provides that a claim of the United States must be paid first when a person indebted to the United States is insolvent and an act of bankruptcy has been committed. Thereafter, the superintendent brought a declaratory judgment action in the United States District Court for the Southern District of Ohio against the United States. The superintendent argued that 3713(a)(1)(A)(iii) did not pre-empt an Ohio statute under which claims of federal, state, and local governments were entitled to only fifth priority--behind administrative expenses, specified wage claims, policyholders' claims, and claims of general creditors--in proceedings to liquidate an insolvent insurance company, because such statute fell within 2(b) of the McCarran-Ferguson Act (15 USCS 1012(b)), which provides that no federal statute will be construed to supersede a state statute enacted ""for the purpose of regulating the business of insurance"" unless the federal statute specifically relates to the business of insurance. The District Court, granting summary judgment for the United States, ruled that the Ohio statute did not involve the ""business of insurance"" pursuant to 2(b). On appeal, the United States Court of Appeals for the Sixth Circuit, reversing, expressed the view that the Ohio statute was exempt from federal pre-emption as a regulation of the ""business of insurance"" within the meaning of the McCarran-Ferguson Act, because the Ohio statute (1) transferred and spread the risk of insurer insolvency; (2) involved an integral part of the policy relationship; and (3) focused upon the protection of policyholders by diverting the scarce resources of the liquidating entity away from other creditors (939 F2d 341).",lexis

"The president of a small business firm believed that he was being denied benefits under a program of the Small Business Administration (SBA) because he had refused to make loans to the accused, an SBA employee who was responsible for the program. Based on the president's allegations, the FBI conducted an investigation of the accused. As part of the investigation, the president, under FBI surveillance, offered the accused a loan. The accused agreed to accept it, and 2 months later, the president met him at a restaurant and gave him the money. The accused was immediately arrested and charged with accepting a gratuity in exchange for an official act, in violation of 18 USCS 201(g). Before trial in a United States District Court, the accused filed a motion in limine seeking to raise an entrapment defense. The District Court denied the motion, ruling that entrapment was not available to the accused because he would not admit all of the elements of the offense charged, including the requisite mental state. At trial, the accused testified that he had accepted the payment as a personal loan unrelated to his duties at the SBA. At the close of trial, the District Court denied the accused's motion for a mistrial based on the court's refusal to instruct the jury as to entrapment. The District Court premised its denial on a ruling that as a matter of law, the accused was not entitled to such an instruction because he would not admit committing all elements of the crime charged.

In renegotiation proceedings involving a contract negotiated by a government department but actually signed only by the contractor and an agency of a foreign government, the Tax Court, without reaching the question of excessive profits, held that there could be no renegotiation under the statute since a government department had not been a party to the contract complained of.

A husband and wife allegedly beat and killed the husband's 4-year-old daughter while all three lived on a federal army base in Louisiana. A federal indictment, relying on the ACA, charged the husband and wife with first-degree murder under a Louisiana statute that (1) defined first-degree murder to include a killing in which the offender had the specific intent to kill or harm a victim under the age of 12, and (2) required a punishment of death or life imprisonment. After a trial in the United States District Court for the Western District of Louisiana, the wife was convicted of Louisiana first-degree murder and sentenced to life imprisonment without parole (848 F Supp 692, 1994 US Dist LEXIS 4531). The United States Court of Appeals for the Fifth Circuit, in affirming in part and reversing in part, (1) expressed the view that the ACA did not permit the application of the Louisiana statute to the wife's acts, as (a) Congress had made those acts punishable as federal second-degree murder under 18 USCS 1111, and (b) the federal and state laws were directed at roughly the same sort of conduct; (2) affirmed the wife's conviction, on the ground that the jury had found all of the requisite elements of federal second-degree murder; and (3) affirmed the sentence, on the ground that the sentence was no greater than the maximum sentence permitted by 1111 (92 F3d 1371, 1996 US App LEXIS 20700).",lexis

His employment contract had contained a provision under which he agreed to arbitrate any dispute that might arise between him and the firm or any other person. Citing this provision, the two other employees sought to have the dispute arbitrated, arguing that as agents and employees of the firm, they were beneficiaries of the arbitration agreement. However, the former employee refused to arbitrate, and the two employees filed a petition in the Superior Court to compel arbitration under 2 of the Federal Arbitration Act (9 USCS 2), which provides that a written provision, in a contract evidencing a transaction involving interstate commerce, to settle by arbitration a controversy arising out of such contract or transaction shall be valid, irrevocable, and enforceable as a matter of federal law, save upon such grounds as exist at law or in equity for the revocation of any contract. The former employee, opposing the petition, cited a California statute providing that actions for the collection of wages may be maintained without regard to the existence of any private agreement to arbitrate.

"The Natural Gas Policy Act (15 USCS 3301 et seq.) establishes price ceilings for wellhead first sales of various categories of natural gas and provides, in 121 of the Act (15 USCS 3331), for phased deregulation through elimination of price ceilings for certain categories. Recognizing that many of the Act's gas categories overlap, Congress provided in 101(b)(5) of the Act (15 USCS 3311(b)(5)) that if natural gas qualifies under more than one provision providing for a maximum lawful price or for an exemption from such a price with respect to any first sale, ""the provision which could result in the highest price shall be applicable."" The Federal Energy Regulatory Commission promulgated a regulation interpreting 121 and 101(b)(5) to mean that any gas that qualified for both deregulated and regulated treatment would be treated as deregulated. This preference for deregulated treatment adversely affected many gas producers who had entered into certain types of long-term gas sales contracts; those producers stood to receive higher contractual prices if their gas were regulated than if it were deregulated. Consequently, numerous producers petitioned the United States Court of Appeals for the Tenth Circuit for review of the Commission's regulation. Rejecting the Commission's interpretation of 121 and 101(b)(5), the Court of Appeals adopted the producers' position that 101(b)(5) unambiguously requires the applicable category to be that which, at any particular moment, results in the producer's receiving the highest contract price for its gas (813 F2d 1059). In explaining this holding, the Court of Appeals also rejected the Commission's ruling that certain ""new tight formation gas"" subject to regulation under 107(c)(5) of the Act (15 USCS 3317(c)(5)) is automatically qualified for deregulation as new gas under 102(c) or 103 of the Act (15 USCS 3312(c), 3313).",lexis

Adopting the so-called “ministerial exception” to laws governing the employment relationship between a religious institution and certain key employees, the Court found relevant Perich’s title as a “Minister of Religion, Commissioned,” her educational training, and her respon- sibility to teach religion and participate with students in religious ac- tivities. Id., at 190–191.
In these cases, two elementary school teachers at Roman Catholic schools in the Archdiocese of Los Angeles had teaching responsibilities similar to Perich’s. Agnes Morrissey-Berru taught at Our Lady of Gua- dalupe School (OLG), and Kristen Biel taught at St. James School. Both were employed under nearly identical agreements that set out the schools’ mission to develop and promote a Catholic School faith community; imposed commitments regarding religious instruction, worship, and personal modeling of the faith; and explained that teach- ers’ performance would be reviewed on those bases. Each was also required to comply with her school’s faculty handbook, which set out similar expectations. Each taught religion in the classroom, wor- shipped with her students, prayed with her students, and had her per- formance measured on religious bases.
Both teachers sued their schools after their employment was termi- nated. Morrissey-Berru claimed that OLG had demoted her and had failed to renew her contract in order to replace her with a younger teacher in violation of the Age Discrimination in Employment Act of 1967. OLG invoked Hosanna-Tabor’s “ministerial exception” and suc- cessfully moved for summary judgment, but the Ninth Circuit re- versed, holding that Morrissey-Berru did not fall within the exception because she did not have the formal title of “minister,” had limited for- mal religious training, and did not hold herself out publicly as a reli- gious leader. Biel alleged that St. James discharged her because she had requested a leave of absence to obtain breast cancer treatment. Like OLG, St. James obtained summary judgment under the “minis- terial exception.” But the Ninth Circuit reversed, reasoning that Biel lacked Perich’s credentials, religious training, and ministerial back- ground.",lexis

"The date for the election of United States representatives is established for all states by 2 USCS 7, which sets such date as the Tuesday after the first Monday in November of every even-numbered year. The same rule is set for the election of United States senators by 2 USCS 1, which provides that senators are to be elected at the same election that representatives are chosen--and hence on the same federal election day. A separate federal statute, 2 USCS 8, provides that the states may prescribe the time for holding elections for a United States representative to fill a vacancy where such vacancy is caused by a failure to elect at the time prescribed by law. Under a Louisiana statutory scheme which took effect in 1978, (1) an election popularly known as an ""open primary"" is to be held in October of a federal election year; (2) in such open primary, (a) all candidates for congressional offices appear on the same ballot, regardless of party, and (b) all voters, with like disregard of party, are entitled to vote; (3) if no candidate for a given office receives a majority in the open primary, a runoff between the two top votegetters is held on the federal election day; and (4) if a candidate receives a majority in the open primary, such candidate ""is elected,"" and no further action is taken on the federal election day to fill the office in question. Since 1978, more than 80 percent of the contested congressional elections in Louisiana ended with the open primary. In 1995, several individuals who were registered to vote in Louisiana filed an action in the United States District Court for the Middle District of Louisiana against Louisiana state officials. The voters alleged that the Louisiana open primary system violated 1 and 7. The District Court granted the state officials' motion for summary judgment. On appeal, a panel of the United States Court of Appeals for the Fifth Circuit, in reversing and in ordering a remand, expressed the view that Louisiana's system conflicted with 1 and 7 (90 F.3d 1026, 1996 US App LEXIS 18733).

"The political party objected to I-872 not in the context of an actual election, but in a facial challenge. The State of Washington had no opportunity to implement I-872, and its courts had no occasion to construe the law in the context of actual disputes arising from the electoral context, or to accord the law a limiting construction to avoid constitutional questions. The party argued that I-872 was unconstitutional as it allowed primary voters who were unaffiliated with a party to choose the party's nominee. The flaw in that argument was that the I-872 primary did not, by its terms, choose parties' nominees. The essence of nomination--the choice of a party representative--did not occur under I-872. The law never referred to the candidates as nominees of any party, nor did it treat them as such under Wash. Admin. Code _ 434-262-012. The assertion that voters would misinterpret the party-preference designation was sheer speculation. There were a variety of ways in which the State could implement I-872 that would eliminate any real threat of voter confusion. Without the specter of widespread voter confusion, the arguments about forced association and compelled speech fell flat.",lexis

"Provisions of the Antiterrorism and Effective Death Penalty Act of 1996, PL 104-132, which added to Title 28 of the United States Code a new Chapter 154 (28 USCS 2261-2266), created an expedited review process, in federal habeas corpus proceedings brought by prisoners who were subject to capital sentences, against states that satisfied certain criteria with respect to the appointment and compensation of counsel for petitioners in state postconviction proceedings. The generally applicable provisions which governed federal habeas corpus relief, Chapter 153 of Title 28 (28 USCS 2241-2255), lacked expedited review procedures. After various California officials publicly indicated that they thought that California qualified under Chapter 154 and that they intended to invoke such chapter's protections, a state prisoner who had been sentenced to death filed a class action in the United States District Court for the Northern District of California against the officials. The class, consisting of capital prisoners in California whose convictions had been affirmed on direct appeal after a certain date, sought declaratory and injunctive relief with respect to the applicability of Chapter 154. The District Court issued (1) a declaratory judgment holding that California did not qualify for Chapter 154 and that such chapter did not apply to any class members, and (2) a preliminary injunction which enjoined the officials from seeking to obtain for California the benefits of Chapter 154's provisions in any state or federal proceedings involving any class member (935 F Supp 1048, 1996 US Dist LEXIS 10902). On appeal, the United States Court of Appeals for the Ninth Circuit, affirming, expressed the view that (1) the Federal Constitution's Eleventh Amendment did not bar the action; (2) the District Court had the authority to issue a declaratory judgment under the Declaratory Judgment Act (28 USCS 2201, 2202), in that there was both an independent basis of federal jurisdiction under 28 USCS 1331 and an actual case or controversy; and (3) the grant of injunctive relief did not interfere with the officials' rights to free speech under the Constitution's First Amendment (123 F3d 1199, 1997 US App LEXIS 21732).",lexis

The plaintiff, who had been convicted under a specification charging an attempt to publish a disloyal statement to members of the armed forces ""with design to promote disloyalty and disaffection among the troops,"" contended that Article 134 was unconstitutionally vague and overbroad on its face and as applied, that his statement was protected speech, and that he was convicted without sufficient evidence of criminal intent.

The accused, who was a resident of Arizona and who practiced law in California, paid $ 125,000 for placer gold-mining claims in Alaska under a partnership agreement whereby he had agreed to finance a gold-mining operation in Alaska. He paid approximately $ 100,000 for mining equipment and supplies, some of which were purchased in California and transported to Alaska. After the partnership dissolved, he continued to operate the mine as a sole proprietorship. On more than one occasion, he hired employees to travel to Alaska to work in the mine. During its operation, the mine produced between $ 200,000 and $ 290,000 worth of gold, $ 30,000 of which he transported out of Alaska. In the United States District Court for the Southern District of California, the accused was convicted of various narcotics offenses and of violating 1962(a) by investing the proceeds of such narcotics offenses in the gold mine.

"Under some provisions (29 USCS 1161 et seq.) of the Employee Retirement Income Security Act of 1974 as amended by the Consolidated Omnibus Budget Reconciliation Act of 1985 (COBRA), a qualified beneficiary of an employer's group health plan is authorized to obtain continued coverage under the plan when the beneficiary might otherwise lose that benefit for certain reasons, such as the termination of employment. At the time pertinent to the case at hand, 29 USCS 1162(2)(D)(i) (later amended) provided that an employer might cancel COBRA continuation coverage as of the date on which the qualified beneficiary first became, ""after the date of the election . . . covered under any other group health plan (as an employee or otherwise)"" that did not contain any exclusion or limitation with respect to any pre-existing condition of the beneficiary. In 1993, a medical corporation fired an individual who had cancer and who had been covered, while employed, under both (1) the corporation's group health plan, and (2) a group health plan provided by his wife's employer. According to the individual, the corporation told him that he had a right to elect COBRA continuation coverage under the corporation's plan. The individual so elected and made the necessary premium payments until, in 1994, the corporation informed the individual that he was not actually entitled to COBRA benefits, as on the date of his COBRA election he had already been covered by another group health plan. The individual then brought suit in the United States District Court for the Eastern District of Missouri against defendants including the corporation. The individual's first two counts claimed that the defendants (1) had violated COBRA by renouncing an obligation to provide continuing coverage, and (2) were estopped to deny him COBRA continuation coverage. The parties agreed to have a magistrate judge conduct all proceedings. The individual (1) moved for partial summary judgment on the first two counts, and (2) included an argument that the defendants' reliance upon 1162(2)(D)(i) to deny him continuation coverage was misplaced, as he had first been covered under his wife's plan before he had elected continuation coverage. While the motion was pending, the individual died and his wife, who was also the personal representative of his estate, replaced him as plaintiff. The magistrate judge granted partial summary judgment in favor of the defendants on the two counts, as the magistrate judge expressed the view that under 1162(2)(D)(i), an employee with coverage under another group health plan as of the date on which the employee elected COBRA continuation coverage was ineligible for such coverage (927 F Supp 352, 1996 US Dist LEXIS 7145). On appeal, the United States Court of Appeals for the Eighth Circuit, in affirming, expressed the view that (1) under 1162(2)(D)(i), it was within the defendants' rights to cancel the individual's COBRA benefits unless there was a ""significant gap"" between the coverage afforded under the corporation's plan and that afforded under his wife's plan; and (2) the wife had failed to carry her burden of showing that such a significant gap existed (114 F3d 1458, 1997 US App LEXIS 13589).",lexis
"To fight the serious harms inflicted by drunk drivers, al States have laws that prohibit motorists from driving with a blood alcohol concentration (BAC) exceeding a specified level. BAC is typicaly determined through a direct analysis of a blood sample or by using a machine to measure the amount of alcohol in a person's breath. To help secure drivers' cooperation with such testing, the States have also enacted ""implied consent"" laws that require drivers to submit to BAC tests. Originaly, the penalty for refusing a test was suspension of the motorist's license. Over time, however, States have toughened their drunk-driving laws, imposing harsher penalties on recidivists and drivers with particularly high BAC levels. Because motorists who fear these increased punishments have strong incentives to reject testing, some States, including North Dakota and Minnesota, now make it a crime to refuse to undergo testing. In these cases, al three petitioners were arrested on drunk-driving charges. The state trooper who arrested petitioner Danny Birchfield advised him of his obligation under North Dakota law to undergo BAC testing and told him, as state law requires, that refusing to submit to a blood test could lead to criminal punishment. Birchfield refused to let his blood be drawn and was charged with a misdemeanor violation of the refusal statute. He entered a conditional guilty plea but argued that the Fourth Amendment prohibited criminalizng his refusal to submit to the test. The State District Court re- jected his argument, and the State Supreme Court armed. After arresting petitioner William Robert Bernard, Jr., Minnesota police transported him to the station. There, officers read him Minnesota's implied consent advisory, which like North Dakota's informs motorists that it is a crime to refuse to submit to a BAC test. Bernard refused to take a breath test and was charged with test refusal in the first degree. The Minnesota District Court dismissed the charges, concluding that the warrantless breath test was not permitted under the Fourth Amendment. The State Court of Appeals reversed, and the State Supreme Court armed. The officer who arrested petitioner Steve Michael Beylund took him to a nearby hospital. The officer read him North Dakota's implied consent advisory, informing him that test refusal in these circumstances is itself a crime. Beylund agreed to have his blood drawn. The test revealed a BAC level more than three times the legal limit. Beylund's license was suspended for two years after an administrative hearing, and on appeal, the State District Court rejected his argument that his consent to the blood test was coerced by the officer's warning.

At the start of trial, the accused's counsel requested permission to present evidence of a prior sexual relationship between the accused and the alleged victim.

After a bench trial in which the defense was based on the issue of consent, the accused was found guilty. The Court of Appeals of Michigan, reversing the conviction, (1) noted that the Court of Appeals, in a previous decision, had found the 10-day notice provision and the hearing requirement unconstitutional when applied to preclude evidence of specific instances of prior sexual conduct between an accused and an alleged victim; (2) said that the previous decision remained valid under the circumstances of the case at hand, since there was evidence indicating that the accused and the alleged victim had had a long-term relationship that had ended only shortly before the alleged crime, and thus the issue of consent had probative validity; and (3) nothing in the record indicated that it would have been proper for the proposed evidence to be excluded as immaterial or unfairly prejudicial (160 Mich App 692, 408 NW2d 431).",lexis

"The motion for leave to proceed in forma pauperis and the petition for writ of certiorari are granted. The judgment is vacated and the case is remanded for further consideration in light of Sanders v. United States, 373 U.S. 1: When brought before the United States District Court for the Northern District of California on a charge of robbery of a federally insured bank, the accused, appearing without counsel, waived the right to the assistance of counsel and the right to proceed by indictment, and pleaded guilty to the charge. He was given a 15-year sentence. Subsequently he filed a motion under 28 USC 2255 to vacate and set aside his sentence on the grounds that the indictment was invalid, that he was denied the assistance of counsel, and that the sentencing court had allowed him to be coerced into entering a plea without counsel and without knowledge of the charges lodged against him. He also applied for a writ of habeas corpus ad testificandum requiring prison authorities to produce him before the court to testify in support of his motion. The sentencing court denied both the motion and the application without a hearing, for the reason that the motion alleged bare conclusions unsupported by facts. The prisoner then filed a second motion under 28 USC 2255, alleging that at the time of the conviction and sentence he was mentally incompetent as a result of narcotics administered to him while he was being held in a county jail pending trial. The sentencing court denied this motion without a hearing on the grounds that (1) there was no reason why the prisoner could not have raised the issue of mental incompetency at the time of the first motion, and (2) the prisoner's allegations were without merit in fact.

"In 2016, petitioner Andy Warhol Foundation for the Visual Arts, Inc. (AWF) licensed to Cond√© Nast for $10,000 an image of ‚ÄúOrange Prince‚Äù‚Äîan orange silkscreen portrait of the musician Prince created by pop artist Andy Warhol‚Äîto appear on the cover of a magazine commemorating Prince. Orange Prince is one of 16 works now known as the Prince Series that Warhol derived from a copyrighted photograph taken in 1981 by respondent Lynn Goldsmith, a professional photographer. Goldsmith had been commissioned by Newsweek in 1981 to photograph a then ‚Äúup and coming‚Äù musician named Prince Rogers Nelson, after which Newsweek published one of Goldsmith‚Äôs photos along with an article about Prince. Years later, Goldsmith granted a limited license to Vanity Fair for use of one of her Prince photos as an ‚Äúartist reference for an illustration.‚Äù The terms of the license included that the use would be for ‚Äúone time‚Äù only. Vanity Fair hired Warhol to create the illustration, and Warhol used Goldsmith‚Äôs photo to create a purple silkscreen portrait of Prince, which appeared with an article about Prince in Vanity Fair‚Äôs November 1984 issue. The magazine credited Goldsmith for the ‚Äúsource photograph‚Äù and paid her $400. After Prince died in 2016, Vanity Fair‚Äôs parent company (Cond√© Nast) asked AWF about reusing the 1984 Vanity Fair image for a special edition magazine that would commemorate Prince. When Cond√© Nast learned about the other Prince Series images, it opted instead to purchase a license from AWF to publish Orange Prince. Goldsmith did not know about the Prince Series until 2016, when she saw Orange Prince on the cover of Cond√© Nast‚Äôs magazine. Goldsmith notified AWF of her belief that it had infringed her copyright. AWF then sued Goldsmith for a declaratory judgment of noninfringement or, in the alternative, fair use. Goldsmith counterclaimed for infringement. The District Court considered the four fair use factors in 17 U. S. C. ¬ß107 and granted AWF summary judgment on its defense of fair use. The Court of Appeals reversed, finding that all four fair use factors favored Goldsmith. In this Court, the sole question presented is whether the first fair use factor, ‚Äúthe purpose and character of the use, including whether such use is of a commercial nature or is for nonprofit educational purposes,‚Äù ¬ß107(1), weighs in favor of AWF‚Äôs recent commercial licensing to Cond√© Nast.",lexis
"After the Navy decided to construct several weapons storage structures capable of storing nuclear weapons, an action was brought in the United States District Court for the District of Hawaii, seeking an injunction against the building of such new facilities until an environmental impact statement had been filed by the Navy pursuant to 102(2)(C) of the National Environmental Policy Act of 1969 (42 USCS 4332(2)(C)), regarding the environmental impact of nuclear weapons storage on the area surrounding the new facilities. The District Court held that the Navy was not required to file an environmental impact statement, even though the construction and operation of such facilities was ""major federal action"" under the National Environmental Policy Act (42 USCS 4321 et seq.), because, given certain national security provisions of the Atomic Energy Act (42 USCS 2011 et seq.) and the Navy's own regulations concerning nuclear weapons, the Navy had complied with the Act ""to the fullest extent possible"" (468 F Supp 190).

The Superior Court granted the Director's motion for summary judgment, holding that the plant owner was liable for severance pay under the statute. The Supreme Judicial Court of Maine affirmed, holding that (1) the statute was not pre-empted by the Employee Retirement Income Security Act of 1974 (29 USCS 1001 et seq.)

"An individual (1) was indicted by an Ohio grand jury on charges of aggravated murder and aggravated robbery, (2) pleaded guilty, and (3) was sentenced to life imprisonment, with parole possible after 30 years. On direct appeal, the individual challenged only the length of the minimum sentence, without success. After unsuccessfully pursuing state postconviction relief, the individual petitioned the Ohio Court of Appeals to reopen his direct appeal on the asserted ground that his original appellate counsel had been constitutionally ineffective in failing to challenge the sufficiency of the evidence. However, the Court of Appeals dismissed the application on the ground that the individual had not shown good cause for failing to file such a petition within the 90-day period established by a state appellate rule. The Supreme Court of Ohio affirmed. The individual thereafter filed a petition for a writ of habeas corpus in the United States District Court for the Southern District of Ohio, which petition alleged in part that (1) the evidence supporting his plea and sentence was insufficient in violation of the Federal Constitution's Fifth and Fourteenth Amendments, and (2) his former counsel had been constitutionally ineffective in failing to raise that claim on direct appeal. The District Court (1) determined that--while the sufficiency claim had been procedurally defaulted--the ineffective-assistance-of-counsel claim (a) could excuse that default, and (b) was not itself barred from review, because the state appellate rule had not been consistently applied by state courts; and (2) granted the petition, conditioned on the state courts reopening direct appeal of the sufficiency claim. On cross-appeals, the United States Court of Appeals for the Sixth Circuit (1) expressed the view that the ineffective-assistance-of-counsel claim could serve as cause to excuse the procedural default of the sufficiency claim, regardless of whether the ineffective-assistance-of-counsel claim had been procedurally defaulted; and (2) ordered that the writ be issued, conditioned on the state courts granting the individual a new culpability hearing (163 F.3d 938).",lexis
"A criminal defendant convicted of murder in a Michigan trial court appealed his conviction to the Michigan Court of Appeals on the ground that the trial court's instruction to the jury on implying malice was erroneous under a previous state court decision which held under state law that malice should not be implied from the fact that a weapon was used. The Michigan Court of Appeals affirmed his conviction, and the Michigan Supreme Court, on review of the record, denied the defendant's request for relief. The defendant then filed a petition for a writ of habeas corpus pursuant to 28 USCS 2254 in the United States District Court for the Eastern District of Michigan, alleging that the state trial court's instruction on malice was unconstitutional. The District Court held that the instruction violated his due process rights by unconstitutionally shifting the burden of proof as to malice to the defendant, being inconsistent with the presumption of innocence, and that the defendant had exhausted available state court remedies, as required by 28 USCS 2254(b) and (c), since his conviction had been reviewed by both the Michigan Court of Appeals and the Michigan Supreme Court (504 F Supp 1135). The United States Court of Appeals for the Sixth Circuit affirmed, holding that the defendant's claim had been properly exhausted in the state courts, because the defendant had presented to the Michigan Court of Appeals the facts on which he based his federal claim, and the defendant's reliance on the previous state court decision was sufficient to present the state court with the substance of his due process challenge to the malice instruction being asserted in the habeas corpus proceedings (664 F2d 610).",lexis

"The Medicaid Act (42 USCS 1396-1396s) establishes a program through which the Federal Government provides financial assistance to states for the provision of medical care to needy individuals. To participate in the program, a state must submit for the approval of the United States Secretary of Health and Human Services a comprehensive plan that contains a scheme for reimbursing health care providers for medical services provided to medicaid patients. Under 42 USCS 1396a(a)(13)(A), also known as the Boren amendment, a reimbursement scheme must provide for reimbursement through the use of rates ""which the State finds, and makes assurances satisfactory to the Secretary [of Health and Human Services], are reasonable and adequate to meet the costs which must be incurred by efficiently and economically operated facilities."" The state of Virginia's medicaid plan was approved by the Secretary in 1982 and again in 1986 after an amendment was made. In 1986, an association of hospitals operating in Virginia filed suit under 42 USCS 1983 in the United States District Court for the Eastern District of Virginia against several state officials. The association alleged that Virginia's medicaid plan violated the Medicaid Act because the reimbursement rates for health care providers were not reasonable and adequate to meet the economically and efficiently incurred costs of providing care to medicaid patients in hospitals, and did not assure access to inpatient care. The association sought declaratory and injunctive relief, including an order requiring the promulgation of a new state medicaid plan with new reimbursement rates and, in the interim, the reimbursement of medicaid providers at rates commensurate with payments under the medicare program. The governor and other defendants filed a motion to dismiss, or in the alternative a motion for summary judgment, on the ground that 1983 did not afford a cause of action to challenge the state's compliance with the Medicaid Act.

"The issue presented is whether the districting plan adopted by the State of Alabama for its 2022 congressional elections likely violated ¬ß2 of the Voting Rights Act, 52 U. S. C. ¬ß10301. As originally enacted in 1965, ¬ß2 of the Act tracked the language of the Fifteenth Amendment, providing that ‚Äú[t]he right of citizens of the United States to vote shall not be denied or abridged . . . on account of race, color, or previous condition of servitude.‚Äù In City of Mobile v. Bolden, 446 U. S. 55, this Court held that the Fifteenth Amendment‚Äîand thus ¬ß2‚Äîprohibits States from acting with a ‚Äúracially discriminatory motivation‚Äù or an ‚Äúinvidious purpose‚Äù to discriminate, but it does not prohibit laws that are discriminatory only in effect. Id., at 61‚Äì65 (plurality opinion). Criticism followed, with many viewing Mobile‚Äôs intent test as not sufficiently protective of voting rights. But others believed that adoption of an effects test would inevitably require a focus on proportionality, calling voting laws into question whenever a minority group won fewer seats in the legislature than its share of the population. Congress ultimately resolved this debate in 1982, reaching a bipartisan compromise that amended ¬ß2 to incorporate both an effects test and a robust disclaimer that ‚Äúnothing‚Äù in ¬ß2 ‚Äúestablishes a right to have members of a protected class elected in numbers equal to their proportion in the population.‚Äù ¬ß10301(b). In 1992, ¬ß2 litigation challenging the State of Alabama‚Äôs then-existing districting map resulted in the State‚Äôs first majority-black district and, subsequently, the State‚Äôs first black Representative since 1877. Alabama‚Äôs congressional map has remained remarkably similar since that litigation. Following the 2020 decennial census, a group of plaintiffs led by Alabama legislator Bobby Singleton sued the State, arguing that the State‚Äôs population growth rendered the existing congressional map malapportioned and racially gerrymandered in violation of the Equal Protection Clause. While litigation was proceeding, the Alabama Legislature‚Äôs Committee on Reapportionment drew a new districting map that would reflect the distribution of the prior decade‚Äôs population growth across the State. The resulting map largely resembled the 2011 map on which it was based and similarly produced only one district in which black voters constituted a majority. That new map was signed into law as HB1. Three groups of Alabama citizens brought suit seeking to stop Alabama‚Äôs Secretary of State from conducting congressional elections under HB1. One group (Caster plaintiffs) challenged HB1 as invalid under ¬ß2. Another group (Milligan plaintiffs) brought claims under ¬ß2 and the Equal Protection Clause of the Fourteenth Amendment. And a third group (the Singleton plaintiffs) amended the complaint in their ongoing litigation to challenge HB1 as a racial gerrymander under the Equal Protection Clause. A three-judge District Court was convened, and the Singleton and Milligan actions were consolidated before that District Court for purposes of preliminary injunction proceedings, while Caster proceeded before one of the judges on a parallel track. After an extensive hearing, the District Court concluded in a 227-page opinion that the question whether HB1 likely violated ¬ß2 was not ‚Äúclose.‚Äù The Court preliminarily enjoined Alabama from using HB1 in forthcoming elections.

"Upon learning that the Republic of Nigeria was interested in contracting for a construction project on an air force base in Nigeria, the chief executive officer (CEO) of a New Jersey corporation made arrangements for a Nigerian citizen to endeavor to secure the contract for the corporation. It was agreed that if the corporation secured the contract, the corporation would funnel a percentage of the contract price as a bribe to officials of the Nigerian government though the payment of a ""commission"" to Panamanian entities which the Nigerian citizen controlled. Both the payment and the receipt of bribes in connection with the award of a government contract were prohibited by Nigerian law. The corporation was awarded the contract, and the bribes were paid. A Pennsylvania corporation, which had been an unsuccessful bidder for the contract, learned of the ""commission"" and brought the matter to the attention of American and Nigerian officials. The New Jersey corporation and its CEO were eventually charged with violations of a federal corrupt practices statute, and both pleaded guilty. The Pennsylvania corporation subsequently brought an action in the United States District Court for the District of New Jersey against the New Jersey corporation, its CEO, the Nigerian citizen, and others, in which action the Pennsylvania corporation sought damages under various federal and state statutes. The defendants moved to dismiss the complaint, on the ground that the action was barred by the act of state doctrine.

"Under 514(a) of the Employee Retirement Income Security Act (ERISA) (29 USCS 1144(a)), state laws that relate to employee benefit plans are pre-empted by ERISA. A California statute, which required contractors who were awarded public works contracts to pay their workers not less than the prevailing wage rate for similar work in the locality in which the public work was performed, allowed public works contractors to pay to an apprentice trained in an apprenticeship program approved under the National Apprenticeship Act, as amended (29 USCS 50), an apprentice wage rate that was less than the prevailing journeyman wage rate. A subcontractor working at a county facility (1) hired apprentices through an unapproved joint apprenticeship training committee program that had been created pursuant to a collective bargaining agreement, and (2) paid the apprentices the apprentice wage rate provided in the bargaining agreement. After a state agency ordered the county to withhold certain moneys from the general contractor because of the subcontractor's failure to pay the prevailing journeyman rate to the apprentices from the unapproved program, the contractors, arguing that with respect to the training program the state's prevailing wage statute was pre-empted under 514(a), filed suit to prevent interference with payment under the subcontract. The United States District Court for the Northern District of California, expressing the view that pre-emption was forestalled by ERISA's saving clause, 514(d) (29 USCS 1144(d)), entered summary judgment against the contractors (778 F.

"he case at hand involved the promulgation by the Federal Motor Carrier Safety Administration (FMCSA), an agency within the Department of Transportation, of certain application and safety-monitoring regulations that would allow some cross-border operations by Mexican-domiciled motor carriers to occur, where (1) even though 49 USCS _ 13902(a)(1) generally mandated that the FMCSA register any qualified motor carrier, a moratorium on new FMCSA grants of operating authority for Mexican-domiciled  [***61]  motor carriers initially had been imposed, and later had been extended, pursuant to 49 USCS _ 10922(l); (2) subsequently, the President of the United States, in asserted fulfillment of the North American Free Trade Agreement (32 ILM 605), had expressed an intention to lift the moratorium; and (3) in May 2001, the FMCSA had initially published for comment the proposed regulations in question. Congress then enacted _ 350 of the Department of Transportation and Related Agencies Appropriations Act, 2002 (note following 49 USCS _ 13902), which provided (in conditions later extended to appropriations for fiscal years 2003 and 2004) that no funds appropriated under the 2002 Act could be obligated or expended to review or to process any application by a Mexican-domiciled motor carrier for authority to operate in the interior of the United States until the FMCSA implemented specific application and safety-monitoring requirements for such carriers. In January 2002, the FMCSA issued a FONSI, which--on the basis of an Environmental Assessment released the same day--concluded that no EIS was needed concerning the proposed regulations. In March 2002, the FMCSA (1) issued the application and safety-monitoring regulations as interim rules with a delayed effective date; and (2) in some accompanying materials, said that a full CAA conformity review was not required.

"An individual was convicted of murder in Superior Court, Bleckley County, Georgia, and a sentencing jury imposed the death penalty after finding three aggravating circumstances set forth in the Georgia death penalty statute. On direct appeal, the Supreme Court of Georgia affirmed, setting aside the second statutory aggravating circumstance found by the jury, but upholding the death sentence on the ground that in the case under review the evidence supported the jury's findings of the other statutory aggravating circumstances, so that the death sentence was not impaired (237 Ga 259, 227 SE2d 261). After exhausting his state post-conviction remedies, the prisoner applied for a writ of habeas corpus in the United States District Court for the Middle District of Georgia.

"An organization of private individuals and the United States each filed suit in the United States District Court for the Eastern District of Pennsylvania to compel the state of Pennsylvania to implement a vehicle emission inspection and maintenance program (I/M program) as required by the Clean Air Act (42 USCS 7410). Pursuant to a consent decree, the state agreed to establish an I/M program for 10 counties in two metropolitan areas in the state. Under the decree, the state transportation department was required to seek legislation instituting a franchise I/M program, and if such legislation was not approved, the transportation department was to promulgate regulations allowing the state to certify a number of private garage facilities to perform the inspections. Implementation of the I/M program did not proceed smoothly, and the factual developments which followed the entry of the consent decree included the following: (1) after the transportation department published the proposed regulations, the state legislature having earlier failed to enact a franchise system, the organization continued to monitor the state's performance under the consent decree and submitted comments on the regulations; (2) after the state legislature enacted a statute prohibiting the expenditure of state funds by the executive branch for the implementation of the I/M program, the organization successfully opposed the state's motion to stay implementation of the consent decree, the Federal District Court ordering the United States Secretary of Transportation to refrain from approving any projects, or awarding any grants, for highways in the two areas covered by the consent decree, with certain exceptions (533 F Supp 869), and on appeal, the United States Court of Appeals for the Third Circuit affirmed (678 F2d 460); and (3) the organization participated in hearings before the United States Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) at which the state unsuccessfully sought the EPA's approval of an I/M program covering a smaller geographic area. The organization then sought attorneys' fees and costs for the work performed after the issuance of the consent decree. The Federal District Court awarded attorneys' fees and costs to the organization and, overruling the state's objections that the organization was seeking compensation for work done in only tangentially related state and federal administrative proceedings, held that the organization was entitled to such compensation for its work in monitoring the state's performance under the consent decree and commenting on the state's proposed regulations and for its participation in the hearings before the EPA; also, the District Court increased the ""lodestar"" amounts--the result of multiplying the number of hours reasonably necessary to perform the legal services for which compensation was sought by a reasonable hourly rate for the attorney providing the services (this rate being based on the court's determination of the attorney's reputation and status and the type of activity for which the attorney was seeking compensation)--with respect to the organization's work in opposing the state's motion to stay implementation of the consent decree, to reflect the low likelihood of success the organization faced in that stage of the litigation and the high quality of representation provided in that stage. The Court of Appeals affirmed and held that (1) the work of counsel in monitoring the state's performance under the consent decree, commenting on the state transportation department's regulations, and participating in the EPA hearings was useful and necessary for securing full enforcement of the decree; and (2) with respect to the adjustment of the lodestar amounts, the evidence showed that the success of counsel was exceptional, and that the quality of the service rendered was superior to that which one should reasonably expect in light of the hourly rates charged (762 F2d 272).",lexis
"These two consolidated cases presented issues as to the validity of the state of Washington's business and occupation (B & O) tax on business activities within the state, including manufacturing and wholesale selling. In the first case (No. 85-2006), 71 commercial enterprises filed 53 separate actions in the Thurston County Superior Court for refunds of B & O taxes paid to the state. The enterprises challenged the state's ""multiple activities"" exemption, under which local manufacturers were exempted from the manufacturing tax for the portion of their output that was subject to the wholesale tax, in other words, for their in-state sales, but sales by local manufacturers to out-of-state purchasers remained subject to the manufacturing tax. The Superior Court joined the actions, found that the exemption did not violate the Federal Constitution's commerce clause (Art I, 8, cl 3), and granted the state taxation department's motion for summary judgment. The Supreme Court of Washington affirmed (105 Wash 2d 328, 715 P2d 128). In the second case (No. 85-1963), an out-of-state manufacturer sued in the Superior Court for a refund of B & O taxes paid for its wholesaling activities within Washington, on the grounds that its business did not have a sufficient nexus with Washington to justify the collection of the tax, and that the tax was not fairly apportioned to reflect the amount of business conducted in the state. This manufacturer had no office, property, or employees in Washington but solicited business in the state under the direction of out-of-state executives and an in-state independent contractor. The Superior Court denied the tax refund, holding that (1) the manufacturer had a sufficient nexus with the state, since the manufacturer's in-state sales representatives helped the manufacturer establish and maintain its market in the state, and (2) the tax was fairly apportioned.

"Medicaid is a cooperative federal-state program that provides medical care to needy individuals. To qualify for federal funds, a State must submit its Medicaid plan and any amendments to the federal agency that administers the program, the Centers for Medicare & Medicaid Services (CMS). Before approving a plan or amendments, CMS conducts a review to determine whether they comply with federal requirements. Federal law requires state plans or amendments to ""assure that payments are consistent with efficiency, economy, and quality of care and are sufficient to enlist enough providers"" to make Medicaid ""care and services"" available. 42 U. S. C. ¬ß1396a(a)(30)(A). After California enacted three statutes reducing the State's payments to various Medicaid providers, the State submitted plan amendments to CMS. Before the agency finished its review, Medicaid providers and beneficiaries sought, in a series of cases, to enjoin the rate reductions on the ground that they were pre-empted by federal Medicaid law. In seven decisions, the Ninth Circuit ultimately affirmed or ordered preliminary injunctions preventing the State from implementing its statutes. The court (1) held that the providers and beneficiaries could bring a Supremacy Clause action; (2) essentially accepted their claim that the State did not show that its amended plan would provide sufficient services; (3) held that the amendments thus conflicted with ¬ß1396a(a)(30)(A); and (4) held that the federal statute pre-empted the new state laws. In the meantime, agency officials disapproved the amendments, and California sought further administrative review. The cases were in this posture when the Court granted certiorari to decide whether respondents could mount a Supremacy Clause challenge.

"In September 2017, the President issued Proclamation No. 9645, seeking to improve vetting procedures for foreign nationals traveling to the United States by identifying ongoing deficiencies in the information needed to assess whether nationals of particular countries present a security threat. The Proclamation placed entry restrictions on the nationals of eight foreign states whose systems for managing and sharing information about their nationals the President deemed inadequate. Foreign states were selected for inclusion based on a review undertaken pursuant to one of the President's earlier Executive Orders. As part of that review, the Department of Homeland Security (DHS), in consultation with the State Department and intelligence agencies, developed an information and risk assessment ‚Äúbaseline.‚Äù DHS then collected and evaluated data for all foreign governments, identifying those having deficient information-sharing practices and presenting national security concerns, as well as other countries ‚Äúat risk‚Äù of failing to meet the baseline. After a 50‚Äìday period during which the State Department made diplomatic efforts to encourage foreign governments to improve their practices, the Acting Secretary of Homeland Security concluded that eight countries‚ÄîChad, Iran, Iraq, Libya, North Korea, Syria, Venezuela, and Yemen‚Äîremained deficient. She recommended entry restrictions for certain nationals from all of those countries but Iraq, which had a close cooperative relationship with the U.S. She also recommended including Somalia, which met the information-sharing component of the baseline standards but had other special risk factors, such as a significant terrorist presence. After consulting with multiple Cabinet members, the President adopted the recommendations and issued the Proclamation. Invoking his authority under 8 U.S.C. ¬ß¬ß 1182(f) and 1185(a), he determined that certain restrictions were necessary to ‚Äúprevent the entry of those foreign nationals about **2400 whom the United States Government lacks sufficient information‚Äù and ‚Äúelicit improved identity-management and information-sharing protocols and practices from foreign governments.‚Äù The Proclamation imposes a range of entry restrictions that vary based on the ‚Äúdistinct circumstances‚Äù in each of the eight countries. It exempts lawful permanent residents and provides *668 case-by-case waivers under certain circumstances. It also directs DHS to assess on a continuing basis whether the restrictions should be modified or continued, and to report to the President every 180 days. At the completion of the first such review period, the President determined that Chad had sufficiently improved its practices, and he accordingly lifted restrictions on its nationals.

On February 1, 1980, a Subchapter S corporation filed, for the tax year of December 26, 1978 to November 30, 1979, a federal income tax return on which the corporation reported a loss deduction and an investment tax credit. On April 15, 1980, a shareholder in the corporation filed, for 1979, a federal income tax return on which the shareholder, pursuant to Subchapter S, claimed a pro rata share of the deduction and credit reported by the corporation.

On the day that the trial began before the commission, the parties stipulated that ""today is the date of taking."" After hearing competing testimony pertaining to the fair market value of the land, the commission entered a report recommending compensation in a specified amount.

The District Court denied the application, ruling that the allowance of such attorneys' fees was not authorized under 4 of the Clayton Act, which provides for recovery of treble damages ""and the cost of suit, including a reasonable attorney's fee."" The Court of Appeals on the plaintiff's appeal and on his simultaneously filed applications for such attorneys' fees, concluded that the Supreme Court's mandate, by not mentioning attorneys' fees, precluded an award of such fees.",lexis

Ultimately, the District Court ruled against the plaintiff, but the United States Court of Appeals for the Eighth Circuit reversed, holding that the provision of publicly financed hospital services for childbirth but not for elective abortions, pursuant to a policy determination of the Mayor of St. Louis prohibiting the performance of abortions in city hospitals except when there was a threat of genuine physiological injury or death to the mother, constituted invidious discrimination violative of equal protection under the Fourteenth Amendment (515 F2d 541).",lexis

"The First Amendment did not confer an affirmative right to use government payroll mechanisms to obtain funds for expression, nor did it prevent a State from deciding that its political subdivisions could not provide payroll deductions for political activities. Idaho had no obligation to aid the unions in their political activities, thus, only a rational basis had to be shown to justify the political payroll deduction ban. The same deferential review applied on the local level. Section 44-2004(2) did not restrict political speech; it declined to promote that speech by allowing public employee checkoffs for political activities. Such a decision was reasonable in light of the State's interest in avoiding the appearance that carrying out the public's business was tainted by partisan political activity and that interest extended to local governments as well. Political subdivisions, created by the State for the better ordering of government, had no privileges or immunities under the federal constitution which they could invoke in opposition to the will of its creator State. That the State did not subsidize local government payroll deductions was immaterial. The Ninth Circuit erred.",lexis
"In 1981, two oil companies paid the Federal Government more than 150 million in return for lease contracts. The contracts gave the companies the rights to explore for and develop oil off the coast of North Carolina, provided that the companies received exploration and development permissions in accordance with various statutes and regulations to which the lease contracts were made subject, among which were (1) the Outer Continental Shelf Lands Act (OCSLA) (43 USCS 1331 et seq.), (2) the Coastal Zone Management Act of 1972 (CZMA) (16 USCS 1451 et seq.), and (3) regulations promulgated pursuant OCSLA and CZMA. Under OCSLA and CZMA, the companies were required, among other things, to (1) prepare, and obtain Department of the Interior approval for, a plan of exploration (43 USCS 1340(c)), and (2) obtain an exploratory well-drilling permit. The Department of the Interior was required to approve any submitted exploration plan within 30 days of a company's submission unless the Department of the Interior found that the proposed exploration would probably cause serious harm or damage to life, to property, to any mineral, to the national security or defense, or to the marine, coastal, or human environment (43 USCS 1334(a)(2)(A)(i)). To obtain a well-drilling permit, the companies were required to certify, under CZMA, that the exploration plan was consistent with the coastal zone management program of North Carolina. If North Carolina objected, then (1) the certification would fail, unless the Secretary of Commerce overrode North Carolina's objection, and (2) if the Secretary of Commerce ruled against the North Carolina, then the Department of the Interior could have granted the permit. In 1990, the companies submitted an exploration plan and CZMA consistency certification to the Department of the Interior. Two days prior to this submission, the Outer Banks Protection Act (OBPA) (104 Stat 555, later repealed) came into effect. OBPA prohibited the Secretary of the Interior from approving any plan until, among other things, (a) an OBPA-created Environmental Sciences Review Panel reported to the Secretary of the Interior, and (b) the Secretary of the Interior certified to Congress that that he or she had sufficient information to make approval decisions required by OSCLA. In addition, OPBA provided that the Secretary of the Interior could not approve any plan for 13 months. The Department of the Interior then (1) told one of the companies that (a) its plan met OCSLA requirements, but (b) the Department of the Interior would not approve the plan until the OBPA requirements were met; (2) suspended all North Carolina offshore leases; (3) after the panel had made its report, made the requisite certification to Congress; and (4) said that the plan would not be considered until the department received further studies recommended by the panel. North Carolina objected to the CZMA certification. The Secretary of Commerce rejected a request by the company to override North Carolina's objection. After North Carolina objected to the certification, but before the Secretary of Commerce rejected the override request, the two companies joined a breach-of-contract lawsuit in the Court of Federal Claims. This court granted summary judgment in favor the companies, as the court found that (1) the Federal Government had broken its contractual promise to follow OCSLA's requirement to approve an exploration plan that satisfied OCSLA's requirements within 30 days of the plan's submission, (2) the government thereby had repudiated the contract, and (3) this repudiation entitled the companies to restitution of the payments (35 Fed Cl 309). The United States Court of Appeals for the Federal Circuit, in reversing, expressed the view that the Federal Government's refusal to consider the companies' final exploration plan was not the operative cause of any failure to carry out the contracts' terms, because North Carolina's objection to the company's CZMA consistency statement would have prevented the companies from exploring (177 F3d 1331).",lexis
"This case, a companion case to Green v County School Board of New Kent County supra, p. 716, and Raney v Board of Education of Gould School District, supra, p. 727, similarly presents the question whether a school board's ""free-transfer"" plan, which permits a child, after registering in his assigned school in his attendance zone, to freely transfer to another school of his choice if space is available, is adequate to comply with the board's responsibility to effectuate a transition from a racially segregated school system to a racially nondiscriminatory system. The school system in question consisted of eight elementary schools, three junior high schools, and two senior high schools. Under the former state law, five of the elementary schools, two of the junior high schools, and one of the senior high schools were operated as ""white"" schools, and the remainder of the schools were operated as ""Negro"" schools.

"An employee who awoke one day with severe pains in his neck, shoulders, and arms, which were later attributed by physicians to an exacerbation of an arthritic condition, contended that he was permanently and totally disabled by the arthritic condition. His retained counsel filed a claim for compensation under the Longshoremen's and Harbor Workers' Compensation Act (33 USCS 901 et seq.), the employee alleging that he had an accident when on the previous day while lifting duct work he felt a sharp pain in his neck.

The Benefits Review Board affirmed the denial of disability benefits, holding that the administrative law judge's findings were supported by substantial evidence.

"In an original action in the United States Supreme Court, filed by Louisiana against Mississippi and an owner of riparian land on the Mississippi side, Louisiana sought to resolve a dispute as to the boundary between the two states in a reach of the Mississippi River. In 1970, Louisiana had executed an oil and gas lease covering the now-disputed area of the riverbed, and in 1971, the landowner had executed a similar lease; both to the same operator. The lessee drilled a well under the river from a surface location on the landowner's property, and the well's bottom-hole was located in Louisiana. In 1979, the landowner brought a suit, alleging that the boundary between the states had migrated westerly, so that the bottom-hole was within Mississippi and subject to his lease. Louisiana's motion to the Supreme Court for leave to file a complaint against Mississippi and the landowner was granted, and the Supreme Court appointed a Special Master. After trial, the Master filed a report, concluding that at all times during the disputed period, 1972-1982, the well's bottom-hole was within Louisiana, west of wherever the boundary might have been, and that it was not necessary to delineate the specific boundary during the relevant years.",lexis
"The Harbor Maintenance Tax (HMT) (26 USCS 4461(a)) obligated exporters, importers, and domestic shippers to pay a uniform percentage of the value of shipments of commercial cargo through the nation's ports. The tax was imposed on exports at the time of loading. HMT monies were deposited in a fund from which Congress could appropriate amounts to pay for harbor maintenance and development projects and related expenses. An exporter, after paying the HMT for articles exported during a portion of 1994, filed a protest with the United States Customs Service, in which protest it was alleged that the HMT, as applied to exports, violated the Federal Constitution's export clause (Art I, 9, cl 5), which provided that no tax or duty was to be laid on articles exported from any state. The Customs Service responded with a letter stating that the HMT was merely a statutorily mandated fee assessment on port users. The exporter, seeking a refund, brought an action against the Federal Government in the United States Court of International Trade (CIT). The CIT, in entering summary judgment for the exporter, concluded that the HMT, as applied, was a tax rather than a user fee--and was thus invalid under the export clause--as the HMT was assessed directly upon the value of the cargo itself and not upon any services rendered for the cargo (907 F Supp 408, 1995 Ct Intl Trade LEXIS 220).

"In 1961, a private civic organization presented the state of Texas with a granite monument, 6 feet high and 3 1/2 feet wide, whose primary content was the text of the Ten Commandments. Among the monument's other features were (1) carvings of an eagle grasping the American flag, an eye inside a pyramid, and two small tablets with what appeared to be an ancient script; (2) two Stars of David; (3) the superimposed Greek letters Chi and Rho, which represented Christ; and (4) an inscription acknowledging the organization's donation of the monument. The organization's stated goal in donating the monument was to highlight the Ten Commandments' role in shaping civic morality, as part of the organization's efforts to combat juvenile delinquency. The organization had consulted with a committee composed of members of several faiths in order to find an assertedly nonsectarian English-language text of the commandments. The monument was placed on the Texas state capitol's grounds, a 22-acre area containing 17 monuments and 21 historical markers that were described by a Texas state legislative resolution as commemorating the ""people, ideals, and events that compose Texan identity."" Among such displays were monuments to ""Heroes of the Alamo"" and veterans of various wars.

"With respect to the quadrennial election of the United States President by means of Presidential electors, (1) Art II, 1, cl 2 of the Federal Constitution provides that each state shall appoint, ""in such Manner as the Legislature thereof may direct,"" a specified number of electors; and (2) 3 USCS 5 in effect provides, insofar as congressional consideration of a state's electoral votes is concerned, that if the state's legislature has provided for final determination of contests or controversies by a law made prior to election day, then that determination shall be conclusive if made at least 6 days prior to the time of meeting of the electors. On November 8, 2000, the day following a Presidential election, the Florida division of elections reported that the Republican candidate for President had received 2,909,135 votes and the Democratic candidate had received 2,907,351 votes, a margin of 1,784 votes. Pursuant to a Florida statute, an automatic machine recount occurred and resulted in a smaller margin of victory for the Republican candidate. The Democratic candidate then exercised his state statutory right to submit written requests for manual recounts in four counties. On November 14, in an action brought by one such county--and joined by a second such county's canvassing board, the Democratic candidate, and the Florida Democratic party--the state's Circuit Court of the Second Judicial Circuit ruled that (1) a 7-day deadline set by a state statutory provision for filing election returns was mandatory, (2) a county's board could amend its returns at a later date, and (3) Florida's secretary of state could exercise her discretion in deciding whether to include the late amended returns in the secretary's statewide certification of the election results. After the secretary determined that none of the submissions by four counties justified an extension of the deadline, the Circuit Court, on November 17, ruled that the secretary had not acted arbitrarily and had exercised her discretion in a reasonable manner. On appeal, Florida's First District Court of Appeal certified the matter to the Florida Supreme Court, which enjoined the secretary and a Florida commission from finally certifying the election results and declaring a winner until further order of that court. On November 21, the Florida Supreme Court issued a decision which effectively extended the 7-day statutory deadline--assuming that it would have applied--by 12 days and directed the secretary to accept manual recounts submitted prior to the extended deadline, as the Florida Supreme Court (1) determined that under the plain text of the Florida statutes, a discrepancy between a sample manual recount and machine returns, due to the way in which a ballot was punched or marked, constituted an error in vote tabulation that was sufficient to trigger the state statutory provisions for a full manual recount; (2) ruled that with respect to ignoring late returns, the ""may""-ignore language of one statutory provision controlled over the ""shall""-ignore language of another provision; (3) relied in part upon a right-to-vote provision in the Florida constitution in concluding that late manual recounts could be rejected only under limited circumstances; and (4) invoked the equitable powers of the court to fashion a remedy, in view of what the court said was a reluctance to rewrite Florida's election code (772 So. 2d 1220, 2000 Fla LEXIS 2311). On November 24, the United States Supreme Court granted a certiorari petition by the Republican candidate and set an expedited schedule for review (531 US ‚àö¬∂‚àö¬∂‚àö¬∂, 148 L Ed 2d 478, 121 S Ct ‚àö¬∂‚àö¬∂‚àö¬∂).",lexis
"A New York state criminal prosecution resulted in convictions for grand larceny, robbery, and second-degree murder under a state statute providing that a person is guilty of murder when he recklessly engages in conduct which creates a grave risk of death to another person ""and thereby causes the death of another person."" The evidence showed that the two defendants, after robbing a thoroughly intoxicated man in their car, had abandoned him at night on an unlighted, rural road, in a state of partial undress and without his coat or glasses, when the temperature was near zero and visibility was obscured by blowing snow, and that the man was struck and killed by a speeding truck 20 or 30 minutes later, while the victim was sitting helplessly in the road. The trial court did not instruct the jury on the statutory issue of causation (the defendants having neither requested such an instruction nor objected to its omission), but defense counsel contended that the truck driver's negligence had caused the victim's death, whereas the prosecution argued that the death was foreseeable and would not have occurred but for the defendants' conduct. The convictions were affirmed by the Supreme Court, Appellate Division, Fourth Department, New York, the sufficiency of the instructions not having been challenged in that court (41 App Div 2d 228, 342 NYS2d 386). The Court of Appeals of New York also affirmed the convictions, refusing to consider the adequacy of the charge to the jury because that question had not been raised in the trial court (35 NY2d 407, 362 NYS2d 848, 321 NE2d 773). One of the defendants then filed a petition for a writ of habeas corpus in the United States District Court for the Northern District of New York, which held that the attack on the sufficiency of the charge failed to raise a question of constitutional dimension.

Two veterans passed New York City civil service examinations, but were denied the veterans' preference because they were residents of Puerto Rico at the time they joined the military.

"A husband was legally obligated to make child support payments to his ex-wife, but fell behind on these payments. His ex-wife applied for Aid to Families with Dependent Children (AFDC) welfare benefits from a state, which, pursuant to 42 USCS 602(a)(26)(A), was assigned the ex-wife's right to collect any accrued child support. The husband filed with his current wife a joint federal income tax return, claiming a refund due in part to an earned income credit to which the couple were entitled under former 43 of the Internal Revenue Code (26 USCS 43, later 26 USCS 32). The Internal Revenue Service, however, notified the couple that a portion of the anticipated refund was being retained, and would be paid the state as accrued child support assignee, under the tax interception authority granted by 464 of the Social Security Act (42 USCS 664, later amended), and 6402(c) of the Internal Revenue Code (26 USCS 6402(c)). After negotiations, the government still withheld half of the additional refund amount claimed.

"These two consolidated cases presented the question whether a state criminal trial court is constitutionally compelled to conduct a hearing outside the presence of the jury whenever a defendant contends that a witness' identification of him was arrived at improperly.

At the trial, these witnesses identified the defendant, but were not asked by the prosecutor about the lineup or the showup. Defendant's counsel, however, cross-examined both witnesses at some length about both the lineup and the showup. In No. 79-5951, a rape victim had selected the defendant's picture from police files as the perpetrator of her rape. A police officer testified to this event at the defendant's subsequent trial in a Kentucky Court, as did the victim and her stepfather, and the victim also identified the defendant as the rapist.

Before the Court of Appeals of Texas, the accused argued that four of the convictions--with respect to offenses allegedly committed between June 1992 and July 1993--could not stand under the former version of the provision, because those convictions were based solely on the testimony of the victim, who was not under 14 at the time of the offenses and had not made a timely outcry. The Court of Appeals, in affirming the convictions, expressed the view that the amended version of the provision was applicable to the case, as this version (1) had not increased the punishment or changed the elements of the offense that the state had to prove, (2) had merely removed existing restrictions upon the competency of some classes of persons as witnesses, and (3) was thus a rule of procedure (963 SW2d 833).

Over the span of 12 years, lawful permanent resident Andre Barton was convicted of state crimes, including a firearms offense, drug of- fenses, and aggravated assault offenses.

Among the eligibility require- ments, a lawful permanent resident must have “resided in the United States continuously for 7 years after having been admitted in any sta- tus.” §1229b(a)(2).

After university police telephoned the United States Secret Service, a Secret Service agent interviewed university employees and was informed that the individual who delivered the letter (1) had stated that ""[h]e should have been assassinated in Bonn,"" (2) had spoken of ""bloody coups"" and ""assassination,"" and (3) had said something about ""across the throat"" while moving his hand horizontally across his throat to simulate a cutting action.

The individual admitted writing and delivering the letter, but he refused to identify ""Mr. Image,"" to answer questions about his feelings toward the President, or to state whether he intended to harm the President; and he answered questions about ""Mr. Image"" in a rambling manner.

Consumer compliance rates are notoriously low, however, and it is estimated that Bellas Hess and Quill cause South Dakota to lose between $48 and $58 million annually.

"The operator of a California ski resort, upon encountering financial difficulties, became a debtor in bankruptcy by filing a petition for relief under Chapter 11 of the Bankruptcy Code in the United States Bankruptcy Court for the Eastern District of California. The debtor's appointed receiver, upon approval of the Bankruptcy Court, sold the debtor's assets, which included the debtor's inventory of skis, to a corporation that also was interested in operating a ski resort. When the California State Board of Equalization assessed a sales tax on the transaction, the receiver brought an adversary proceeding in Bankruptcy Court against the board and asked that the court enjoin collection of the assessment. In 1983, the Bankruptcy Court ruled that the transaction was exempt from taxation by the board, pursuant to the holdings of the United States Court of Appeals for the Ninth Circuit in (1) California State Board of Equalization v Goggin (1957, CA9 Cal) 245 F2d 44, cert den 353 US 961, 1 L Ed 2d 910, 77 S Ct 863 (Goggin II), where the court--while construing 28 USCS 960, which generally subjects those conducting business under authority of United States courts to the same taxation applicable to individuals or corporations, to be inapplicable to ""essential sales in liquidation""--held that the collection of use taxes imposed on the use of goods from a bankruptcy liquidation sale on which no sales taxes had been paid was unlawful because such taxes burdened the essential processes of a Bankruptcy Court, and (2) an earlier case involving the same parties (Goggin I). The Bankruptcy Court granted the injunctive relief that the receiver had requested, in the form of an order prohibiting the board from assessing ""a sales or other tax"" against the receiver ""or other parties"" by reason of the receiver's sale of the debtor's assets to the corporation. The corporation began its ski resort operations, including the rental of ski equipment previously purchased from the debtor. In 1985, the board audited the corporation, determined that the corporation owed use taxes on its income from rentals of the skis, and assessed liability for such taxes. The corporation, seeking to prevent the board's imposition of use taxes on its ski rentals, petitioned the Bankruptcy Court for such relief pursuant to its 1983 order. The Bankruptcy Court denied the requested relief, holding on the merits that its 1983 order did not bar the use tax that the board sought to impose. On appeal by the corporation, the United States Bankruptcy Appellate Panel of the Ninth Circuit reversed, ruling that, in light of the injunction previously entered by the Bankruptcy Court and the holdings in the Goggin decisions, the board's assessment of a use tax upon the rentals of skis that had been acquired at a bankruptcy liquidation sale was improper (76 BR 757). On appeal by the board, the United States Court of Appeals for the Ninth Circuit affirmed, holding that the board's attempt to tax the ski rentals was prohibited by Goggin II and the Bankruptcy Court's injunction, and rejecting the board's argument that Goggin II had been wrongly decided (847 F2d 570).",lexis
"Petitioner PPL Montana, LLC (PPL), owns and operates hydroelectric facilities in Montana. Ten of its facilities are located on riverbeds underlying segments of the Missouri, Madison, and Clark Fork Rivers. Five hydroelectric dams on the Upper Missouri River are along the Great Falls reach, including on the three tallest waterfalls; and PPL's two other dams on that river are in canyons on the Stubbs Ferry stretch. These, together with two dams located in steep canyons on the Madison River, are called the Missouri-Madison project. The Thompson Falls project is a facility on the Clark Fork River. Both projects are licensed by the Federal Energy Regulatory Commission. PPL's facilities have existed for many decades, some for over a century. Until recently, Montana, though aware of the projects' existence, sought no rent for use of the riverbeds. Instead, the understanding of PPL and the United States is that PPL has paid rents to the United States. In 2003, parents of Montana schoolchildren filed a federal suit, claiming that PPL's facilities were on riverbeds that were state owned and part of Montana's school trust lands. The State joined the suit and, for the first time, sought rents from PPL for its use of the riverbeds. That case was dismissed, and PPL and other power companies filed a state-court suit, claiming that Montana was barred from seeking compensation for PPL's riverbed use. Montana counterclaimed, contending that under the equal-footing doctrine it owns the riverbeds and can charge rent for their use. The trial court granted Montana summary judgment as to navigability for purposes of determining riverbed title and ordered PPL to pay Montana $41 million in rent for riverbed use between 2000 and 2007. The Montana Supreme Court affirmed. Adopting a liberal construction of the navigability test, it discounted this Court's approach of considering the navigability of particular river segments for purposes of determining whether a State acquired title to the riverbeds underlying those segments at the time of statehood. Instead, the Montana court declared the river stretches in question to be short interruptions of navigability that were insufficient as a matter of law to find nonnavigability, since traffic had circumvented those stretches by portage.

"Under a West Virginia program that allowed foreign medical school graduates to practice under a temporary permit while studying for the state licensing exams, some physicians were allowed to practice for years, even though they repeatedly failed the state exams. After several temporarily licensed physicians formed an organization to represent their interests, a West Virginia state legislator, who was a leading supporter of the program, (1) sponsored a bill extending the program for another year; (2) after discussing with an organization lobbyist possible legislation that would grant temporarily licensed foreign physicians a permanent medical license by virtue of their years of experience, agreed to sponsor such legislation; and (3) during a 1984 re-election campaign, informed the lobbyist that (a) the campaign was expensive and involved considerable expenditures of the legislator's own funds, and (b) the legislator had not heard anything from the foreign physicians. The legislator thereafter received from some of the foreign physicians cash which the legislator neither listed as campaign contributions nor reported as income on his 1984 federal income tax return. Although the physicians' organization kept detailed books of its expenditures, the cash payments, rather than being listed as campaign contributions, had entries accompanied only by initials or other codes signifying that the payments were to the legislator. Two weeks after the permanent-license legislation was enacted, the legislator received more cash from the foreign physicians. The legislator was indicted for (1) violating the Hobbs Act (18 USCS 1951), which prohibits extortion--the consensual obtaining of property from another by wrongful use of actual or threatened force, violence, or fear, or under color of official right--by allegedly extorting payments under color of official right; and (2) filing a false income tax return in violation of 26 USCS 7206(1), by allegedly failing to report as income the cash that was received from the foreign physicians. The jury was instructed that (1) extortion does not occur when a public official receives a legitimate gift or voluntary political contribution, (2) a voluntary payment is one that is freely given without expectation of benefit, and (3) a voluntary political contribution is not taxable income, provided that the contribution is used for campaign expenses. The legislator was convicted under the Hobbs Act with respect to one physician's payment and was convicted under 7206(1).

The individual, alleging that her termination had deprived her of property without due process of law in violation of the Federal Constitution's Fourteenth Amendment, sought damages under 42 USCS 1983. The officials moved to dismiss the individual's complaint on the ground that the officials were entitled to qualified immunity. However, the trial court, treating the motion as a motion for summary judgment because affidavits had been filed in support, denied the motion.

"In 1958, an individual was convicted in a Washington state court of robbery and sentenced to 20 years' imprisonment, and he was paroled in 1962. In 1976, while on parole from sentences imposed by state courts for a 1965 conviction, the individual (1) was convicted in federal court of bank robbery and conspiracy and was sentenced to 30 years' imprisonment, and (2) was also convicted in a Washington state court of assault and aiding a prisoner to escape. In 1978, the individual was sentenced on the 1976 state conviction to two life terms and one 10-year term of imprisonment, which sentence was lengthened by 2 1/2 years because of the individual's prior convictions; since the individual was then serving a federal sentence, Washington state authorities placed a detainer on him requesting that the state be notified when his federal term expired, at which time he was scheduled to begin serving his state sentence. In 1985, the individual, still a federal prisoner, filed a pro se petition for a writ of habeas corpus in the United States District Court for the Western District of Washington, in which petition he (1) challenged the validity of his 1958 conviction, and (2) alleged that the 1958 conviction had been used illegally to enhance his 1978 state sentence. The District Court dismissed the petition for lack of subject-matter jurisdiction, on the ground that the individual was not ""in custody"" for purposes of a habeas corpus attack on the 1958 conviction, because the sentence imposed under that conviction had expired. In reversing the District Court's judgment, the United States Court of Appeals for the Ninth Circuit held that the individual was ""in custody,"" for purposes of such a challenge to the 1958 conviction, satisfying the requirement of 28 USCS 2241(c)(3), because that conviction had been used to enhance the 1978 state sentence, which he had not yet begun to serve (847 F2d 616).",lexis

Subsequently, she filed suit against the United States in the United States District Court for the Southern District of California, under the FTCA, for the Federal Aviation Administration's alleged negligence with respect to the runway lights and air traffic control. Almost a year later, the woman moved to amend the federal complaint to include claims against the original state-court defendants, as to which no independent base for federal jurisdiction existed.

The definitions of percentile indicated that to identify the relevant percentile cutoffs, a distribution of values had to be constructed. The instruction to identify the 95th and 5th ""percentile of such expenditures"" made clear that the relevant characteristic for ranking purposes was per-pupil expenditure during a particular year. Context supported the finding that the instruction to identify districts with ""per-pupil expenditures"" above the 95th percentile ""of such expenditures"" was ambiguous, because both students and school districts were of concern.

"In 1985, a Virginia statute prohibiting the sale to juveniles of sexual or sadomasochistic materials which are ""harmful to juveniles"" was amended by adding a provision making it a crime ""to knowingly display for commercial purpose in a manner whereby juveniles may examine and peruse"" such materials, even if the materials are not actually sold to any juvenile. The term ""harmful to juveniles"" was defined elsewhere in the statute. Approximately two weeks after the effective date of the 1985 amendment, and prior to any enforcement action thereunder, several booksellers filed suit under 42 USCS 1983 in the United States District Court for the Eastern District of Virginia. The booksellers, seeking declaratory and injunctive relief against the enforcement of the 1985 amendment, alleged that the amendment was facially invalid for overbreadth, in that it unconstitutionally burdened adult book buyers' access to nonobscene materials under the First Amendment of the Federal Constitution. The defendants, who included local officials and the Commonwealth of Virginia, challenged the booksellers' reading of the amendment's reach, arguing that it extended only to ""borderline obscenity."" Based upon the direct testimony of booksellers who stated that the 1985 amendment might apply to between 30 and 50 percent of their inventory, and based upon the District Court's own review of a number of books which the booksellers introduced into evidence as examples of material believed to be covered by the 1985 amendment--and notwithstanding the booksellers' testimony that they were unfamiliar with the portion of the law defining ""harmful to juveniles""--the District Court found as a factual matter that the 1985 amendment covered between 5 and 25 percent of a typical bookseller's inventory, concluded as a matter of law that the amendment was overbroad, and permanently enjoined its enforcement (617 F Supp 699). On appeal, the United States Court of Appeals for the Fourth Circuit affirmed as to the unconstitutional overbreadth of the 1985 amendment, while acknowledging that ""little specific evidence"" had been presented in the District Court as to what percentage of a booksellers' inventory might be subject to the amendment's restrictions (802 F2d 691).",lexis

The United States Court of Appeals for the Seventh Circuit has ruled that convictions that were not formally consolidated for sentencing may be considered functionally consolidated, for purposes of the Guidelines, if the convictions were factually or logically related and sentencing was joint. In the United States District Court for the Eastern District of Wisconsin, a defendant--who had four prior felony convictions in state court for gas-station robberies and one for a drug offense--pleaded guilty to federal charges of armed bank robbery. At sentencing, the defendant contended that her drug conviction had been consolidated for sentencing with the robbery convictions--which the prosecution conceded were ""related"" to each other--as the defendant argued that (1) the robberies allegedly had been motivated by her drug habit; (2) the drugs had been found in her home by police searching for evidence of the robberies; and (3) the same state-court judge had (a) heard arguments about sentencing in all five cases in a single proceeding, (b) issued sentences in all five cases at the same time, and (c) ordered that the drug sentence run concurrently with the sentences for robbery. The District Court, however, ruled that the robbery and drug cases had not been consolidated, either formally or functionally, as the District Court placed greater weight on the circumstances that (1) the robbery and drug offenses had been charged in separate indictments and handled by different prosecutors, both at trial and before the sentencing court; (2) the defendant's guilty plea on the drug charge had been heard in a separate proceeding; and (3) the robbery and drug sentences had been issued in separate judgments.

"The present controversy arises from a long-standing dispute between the coastal states and the federal government over their respective rights to exploit the oil and other natural resources of off-shore submerged lands. In United States v California (1947) 332 US 19, 91 L ed 1889, 67 S Ct 1658, the Supreme Court of the United States held that, as against California, the United States possessed paramount rights in such lands underlying the Pacific Ocean seaward of the low-water mark on the coast of California and outside of inland waters. In 1950, the Court made like holdings with respect to submerged lands in the Gulf of Mexico similarly lying off the coasts of Louisiana and Texas. United States v Louisiana, 339 US 699, 94 L ed 1216, 70 S Ct 914; United States v Texas, 339 US 707, 94 L ed 1221, 70 S Ct 918.

"In Anders v California (1967) 386 US 738, 18 L Ed 2d 493, 87 S Ct 1396, the United States Supreme Court, in holding that California's then existing procedure for handling potentially frivolous criminal appeals by convicted indigents violated the Federal Constitution's Fourteenth Amendment, set out what would be an acceptable procedure for treating such appeals, under which procedure (1) counsel who finds an appeal to be frivolous should so advise the appellate court and request permission to withdraw, (2) counsel's request must be accompanied by a brief referring to anything in the record that might arguably support the appeal, and (3) the court then decided whether the case is frivolous. Subsequently, the California Supreme Court adopted a new procedure, under which (1) counsel (a) upon concluding that an appeal would be frivolous, filed a brief with the appellate court that summarized the procedural and factual history of the case, (b) attests that counsel has reviewed the record, explained counsel's evaluation of the case to the client, provided the client with a copy of the brief, and informed the client of the client's right to file a pro se supplemental brief, (c) requests that the court independently examine the record for arguable issues, (d) neither explicitly states a conclusion that an appeal would be frivolous nor requests leave to withdraw, (e) is silent on the merits of the case, and (f) expresses counsel's availability to brief any issues on which the court might desire briefing; and (2) the appellate court must conduct a review of the entire record. An accused who, after representing himself at a California state court trial, had been convicted of murder and grand theft, received appointed counsel on appeal. Counsel, concluding that an appeal would be frivolous, filed a brief that complied with the new California procedure, and the accused filed a pro se supplemental brief. After the California Court of Appeal affirmed the accused's conviction, the California Supreme Court denied the accused's petition for review. The accused filed, in the United States District Court for the Central District of California pursuant to 28 USCS 2254, a writ of habeas corpus alleging, among other things, that the accused had been denied effective assistance of appellate counsel because counsel's brief filed in accordance with the new California procedure failed to comply with the procedure set forth in Anders v California.

"The Resource Conservation and Recovery Act of 1976 (RCRA) is a comprehensive environmental statute that empowers the Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) to regulate hazardous waste in accordance with the rigorous safeguards and waste management procedures of Subtitle C (42 USCS 6921-6934), while nonhazardous wastes are regulated much more loosely under Subtitle D (42 USCS 6941-6949). The city of Chicago owned and operated a municipal incinerator that burned solid waste and recovered energy, leaving a residue of ash. In 1988, an environmental organization (1) filed a complaint in the United States District Court for the Northern District of Illinois against the city and its mayor under RCRA's citizen suit provision (42 USCS 6972); and (2) alleged that the city and the mayor were violating provisions of RCRA and of implementing EPA regulations. While it was uncontested that with respect to the incinerator ash, the city and the mayor had not adhered to Subtitle C's requirements, the city and the mayor contended that the ash was exempted from those requirements by 3001(i) of the Solid Waste Disposal Act (42 USCS 6921(i))--an RCRA provision which had been added in a 1984 amendment as a clarification of a household waste exclusion from regulation, after the EPA had issued some 1980 regulations involving such an exclusion. The District Court agreed with the contention of the city and the mayor (727 F Supp 419) and subsequently granted a motion by the city and the mayor for summary judgment. On appeal, the United States Court of Appeals for the Seventh Circuit, in 1991, reversed on the ground that the ash generated from the incinerators of municipal resource recovery facilities was subject to regulation as a hazardous waste under Subtitle C 48 F2d 345). In 1992, the Administrator of EPA issued a memorandum expressing the agency's view to the effect that pursuant to 3001(i), municipal waste combustion ash was exempt from hazardous waste regulation under Subtitle C.

"Under 5 of the Voting Rights Act of 1965 (42 USCS 1973c), some states and their political subdivisions may not implement any change in a voting qualification, prerequisite, standard, practice, or procedure unless the state or subdivision first obtains either (1) administrative preclearance of that change from the United States Attorney General, or (2) judicial preclearance from the United States District Court for the District of Columbia. Bossier Parish, Louisiana, was a jurisdiction subject to the 5 preclearance requirements. In order to equalize the population distribution among the 12 electoral districts for the parish's school board, the board, in 1992, adopted a redistricting plan which had been recently adopted by the Bossier Parish police jury--the parish's primary governing body--to govern the jury's own elections. This plan, for which the jury had obtained the Attorney General's preclearance, likewise contained 12 districts. None of the districts in the board's existing plan or in the jury plan contained a majority of black residents. In adopting the jury plan, the board rejected an alternative 12-district plan that would have included two districts each containing a majority of voting-age black residents. The Attorney General (1) objected to the board's use of the jury plan on the basis of new information not previously available, that is, the alternative plan; (2) asserted that the board's redistricting plan violated 2 of the Voting Rights Act (42 USCS 1973) by unnecessarily limiting the opportunity for minority voters to elect their candidates of choice; and (3) concluded that the board's plan warranted a denial of preclearance. The board filed a preclearance action in the District Court against the Attorney General. The District Court, in granting preclearance, said that the District Court would not (1) deny preclearance of a proposed voting change under 5 simply because the change violated 2, or (2) permit 2 evidence to prove discriminatory purpose under 5 (907 F Supp 434). The United States Supreme Court, in vacating the District Court's judgment and in remanding the case for further proceedings, held that (1) a proposed voting change could not be denied preclearance simply because the change violated 2; and (2) evidence of a dilutive but nonretrogressive effect forbidden by 2 could, in some circumstances, be relevant to whether a plan was enacted with a retrogressive purpose forbidden by 5 (520 US 471, 137 L Ed 2d 730, 117 S Ct 1491). On remand, the District Court, in again granting preclearance, (1) expressed the view that retrogressive intent had not been established, but (2) left open the question, which the Supreme Court had left open on remand, as to whether the 5 purpose inquiry extended beyond the search for retrogressive intent (7 F Supp 2d 29).",lexis

"As of 1996, South Carolina law provided that (1) capital jurors at the sentencing phase of a trial were to decide first whether the state had proved beyond a reasonable doubt the existence of any statutory aggravating circumstance; (2) if the jury failed to agree unanimously on the presence of a statutory aggravator, then the trial judge was to sentence the defendant to either life imprisonment or a mandatory minimum 30-year prison term; and (3) if the jury unanimously found a statutory aggravator, then the jury was to recommend either a death sentence or life imprisonment without the possibility of parole. A South Carolina trial court jury found a defendant guilty of a 1997 murder and other crimes. During the trial's sentencing phase, the judge refused--on the ground that the defendant's future dangerousness had not been argued--to instruct the jury that a life sentence would carry no possibility of parole. Instead, the judge told the jury that ""life imprisonment means until the death of the defendant."" The judge also refused to allow defense counsel to state plainly in his closing argument that a life sentence in South Carolina carried no possibility of parole. Accordingly, defense counsel's closing argument stated merely that if the defendant's life was spared, the defendant would ""die in prison"" after ""spend[ing] his natural life there."" During sentencing deliberations, the jury asked the judge whether, and under what circumstances, someone convicted of murder could become eligible for parole. The judge responded that parole eligibility or ineligibility was not for the jury's consideration. The jury, unanimously finding an aggravating factor beyond a reasonable doubt, recommended a death sentence, which the judge imposed. The Supreme Court of South Carolina, in affirming, (1) acknowledged that when a defendant's future dangerousness is at issue and the only available alternative sentence to the death penalty is life imprisonment without parole, due process entitles the defendant to inform the jury that the defendant is parole ineligible; but (2) reasoned that this rule was inapplicable in the case at hand, for when the jury began its deliberations, there was a potential alternative--a mandatory minimum 30-year sentence--to death or life without the possibility of parole (340 SC 291, 531 SE2d 524).",lexis
"Section 5 of the Voting Rights Act of 1965, as amended (42 USCS _ 1973c), requires that a covered jurisdiction's change in a voting ""standard, practice, or procedure"" must be precleared, either by the United States Attorney General or by the United States District Court for the District of Columbia, in order to ensure that the change ""does not have the purpose and will not have the effect of denying or abridging the right to vote on account of race or color."" For such purposes, the United States Supreme Court has generally held that the determination whether such a change should be precleared depends on whether the change would lead to a ""retrogression"" in the position of racial minorities with respect to their effective exercise of the electoral franchise. Georgia was a covered jurisdiction for _ 5 purposes. After the 1990 census, there were some redistricting disputes involving Georgia's United States House of Representatives seats and the seats in the two houses of the state's legislature. Eventually, among other dispositions, the state's 1997 plan for redistricting the state's senate was precleared. After the 2000 census, there were again redistricting disputes. In 2001, the state enacted a new redistricting plan for the state's senate. Subsequently, the state (1) filed a preclearance suit in the District Court for the District of Columbia; and (2) sought a declaratory judgment that several redistricting plans, including the 2001 state-senate plan, did not violate _ 5. The United States, through its Attorney General, opposed preclearance of the 2001 plan and argued that the plan's changes to three state-senate  [***429]  districts--in each of which the plan assertedly reduced the percentage of black voting-age population to just over 50 percent--unlawfully reduced the ability of black voters to elect candidates of their choice. Eventually, the District Court, in pertinent part, denied _ 5 preclearance for the 2001 plan, as the court expressed the view that (1) the three districts in question were retrogressive, for in each of those districts, a lesser opportunity existed for a black candidate of choice to win election under the new plan than under the benchmark 1997 plan; and (2) Georgia had ""failed to present any . . . evidence"" that the retrogression in those three districts would be offset by gains in other districts (195 F Supp 2d 25).",lexis
"The explosion of a bomb which had been sent through the mail killed two persons and injured a third person. After the defendant was tried in a Washington state court for the murder of one of the persons, the jury decided that the defendant was not the person who had mailed the bomb, and the jury therefore acquitted the defendant. The state subsequently prosecuted the defendant for the murder of the other person killed by the bomb and for the assault of the person injured by the bomb. Rejecting the defendant's pleas of former jeopardy and collateral estoppel, the Supreme Court of Washington held that since a letter which had been excluded at the first trial, and which allegedly had been written by the defendant and contained threats against the lives of two of the victims of the explosion, would be admissible at the second trial, the issue of the identity of the person who had mailed the bomb had not been fully litigated at the first trial, and the doctrine of collateral estoppel did not bar a subsequent trial at which litigation of the issue of identity would be complete (78 Wash 2d 894, 480 P2d 484).",lexis
"A collective labor contract between a union and a publisher contained a clause incorporating the general laws of the union not in conflict with the contract or with federal or state law (""General Laws"" clause); the contract further provided that the employer's mail-room foremen must be members of the union and should do the hiring (""Foreman"" clause). Upon a charge of nonunion employees that foremen discriminated in favor of union men, the National Labor Relations Board concluded that the union and the employer had violated the provisions of the National Labor Relations Act which prohibit discrimination in regard to hire or tenure of employment to encourage or discourage membership in any labor organization.

The remedial order of the board contained various provisions, including a direction that all employees in the mail rooms be reimbursed for dues and assessments paid the union for a specified period.

"This case represents the latest conflict between Texas gaming officials and the Ysleta del Sur Pueblo Indian Tribe. In 1968, Congress recognized the Ysleta del Sur Pueblo as an Indian tribe and assigned its trust responsibilities for the Tribe to Texas. 82 Stat. 93. In 1983, Texas renounced its trust responsibilities as inconsistent with the State‚Äôs Constitution. The State also expressed opposition to any new federal trust legislation that did not permit the State to apply its own gaming laws on tribal lands. Congress restored the Tribe‚Äôs federal trust status in 1987 when it adopted the Ysleta del Sur and Alabama and Coushatta Indian Tribes of Texas Restoration Act. 101 Stat. 666. The Restoration Act also ‚Äúprohibited‚Äù as a matter of federal law ‚Äú[a]ll gaming activities which are prohibited by the laws of the State of Texas.‚Äù Id., at 668. Shortly thereafter, Congress adopted its own comprehensive Indian gaming legislation: the Indian Gaming Regulatory Act (IGRA). IGRA established rules for separate classes of games. As relevant here, IGRA permitted Tribes to offer so-called class II games‚Äîlike bingo‚Äîin States that ‚Äúpermi[t] such gaming for any purpose by any person, organization or entity.‚Äù 25 U. S. C. ¬ß2710(b)(1)(A). IGRA allowed Tribes to offer class III games‚Äîlike blackjack and baccarat‚Äîbut only pursuant to negotiated tribal/state compacts. ¬ß2703(8). Pursuant to IGRA, the Tribe sought to negotiate a compact with Texas to offer class III games. Texas refused, arguing that the Restoration Act displaced IGRA and required the Tribe to follow all of the State‚Äôs gaming laws on tribal lands. In subsequent federal litigation, the District Court held that Texas violated IGRA by failing to negotiate in good faith. The Fifth Circuit reversed, holding that the Restoration Act‚Äôs directions superseded IGRA‚Äôs and guaranteed that the entirety of ‚ÄúTexas‚Äô gaming laws and regulations‚Äù would ‚Äúoperate as surrogate federal law on the Tribe‚Äôs reservation.‚Äù 36 F. 3d 1325, 1326, 1334 (Ysleta I). In 2016, the Tribe began to offer bingo, including ‚Äúelectronic bingo‚Äù machines, on the view that IGRA treats bingo as a class II game for which no state permission is required so long as the State permits the game to be played on some terms by some persons. The State then sought to shut down all of the Tribe‚Äôs bingo operations. Bound by Ysleta I, the District Court sided with Texas and enjoined the Tribe‚Äôs bingo operations, but the court stayed the injunction pending appeal. The Fifth Circuit reaffirmed Ysleta I and held that the Tribe‚Äôs bingo operations were impermissible because they did not conform to Texas‚Äôs bingo regulations.",lexis
"Several voters from Winston County, Mississippi, filed an action in the Chancery Court of Winston County, seeking to enforce a neglected state statute passed in 1964, which prescribed the composition and election procedures for members of boards of trustees of all municipal separate school districts. The statute also prescribed a separate procedure, applicable only to Winston County. The Chancery Court dismissed the voters' complaint, holding that the statute violated Mississippi's constitutional bar against local legislation. The Supreme Court of Mississippi reversed, striking only the specific reference which limited application of the special election procedure to Winston County, upholding the remainder of the statute, and remanding to the Chancery Court for further proceedings not inconsistent with its opinion (365 So 2d 947). Certain local county officials then filed a petition for rehearing, in which they argued for the first time that the Chancery Court could not implement the reformed statute until the change had been precleared with the Attorney General of the United States pursuant to 5 of the Voting Rights Act of 1965 (42 USCS 1973c). The Supreme Court of Mississippi denied the petition without comment and the United States Supreme Court denied certiorari (60 L Ed 2d 1049). On remand, the Chancery Court ordered an election pursuant to the redacted statute and, agreeing that the changes in election procedure fell within 5, directed that local officials submit the election plan to the Attorney General for preclearance. The Attorney General objected to the plan, arguing that the procedure requiring a runoff between the two leading candidates absent any candidate's receiving a majority of the vote had a discriminatory effect. The Chancery Court then ordered that its decree calling for an election remain in force subject to compliance with the Act. The voters again appealed to the Supreme Court of Mississippi, which observed that its prior decision was the law of the case and held that the Chancery Court properly enforced the law requiring runoffs but improperly conditioned the election on compliance with the Voting Rights Act (399 So 2d 1356).",lexis

"Under the federal Medicare program, qualified providers of health care services are eligible for reimbursement from the Secretary of Health and Human Services for the reasonable cost of providing covered services to Medicare beneficiaries. As part of the reimbursement procedure, the provider is required to submit a cost report at year's end to a fiscal intermediary, which is usually a private insurance company acting as the Secretary's agent. In 1979, the Secretary promulgated a regulation which instituted a new method for apportioning malpractice insurance premium costs associated with a provider's care of Medicare patients, for purposes of determining the provider's reimbursement under the Medicare program. Subsequently, two providers, in submitting the required cost reports for 1980 to the fiscal intermediary, complied with the 1979 regulation, disclosing their Medicare-related malpractice insurance costs but claiming reimbursement for only that portion allowable under the regulation. The fiscal intermediary which reviewed the providers' cost reports issued a notice of program reimbursement to each. The providers later filed a request for a hearing before the Provider Reimbursement Review Board (the Board), in which they challenged the validity of the 1979 regulation and sought reimbursement for malpractice costs pursuant to the method of calculating such costs in effect prior to the promulgation of the regulation. The Board ruled that, insofar as the providers had effected a ""self-disallowance"" of the malpractice costs which they had disclosed but not claimed on the cost reports, the providers had made no claim for reimbursement of the additional malpractice costs to the fiscal intermediary, and hence the Board lacked jurisdiction over the providers' appeal from the fiscal intermediary's final determination, pursuant to 42 USCS 1395oo. The providers then filed an action against the Secretary in the United States District Court for the Southern District of Ohio, which determined that the Board erred in concluding that it had no jurisdiction to review the providers' claims for reimbursement of their self-disallowed costs (609 F Supp 1360).

"In 2000, the Maine legislature enacted a statute that established a program to reduce prescription drug prices for Maine residents. The program, which was open to all residents, was primarily intended to enable uninsured residents to buy prescription drugs from retail pharmacies at discounts that were approximately equal the rebates available to Medicaid participants under the Medicaid Act (42 USCS __ 1396 et seq.). Under the program, the state would attempt to negotiate rebates with drug manufacturers to fund reduced prices for drugs offered to program participants. If a manufacturer refused to enter into such a rebate agreement, then the state would generally subject the manufacturer's Medicaid sales to a ""prior authorization"" procedure that required state approval to qualify a prescription for reimbursement.

"Under 29 USCS 623(f)(2), age-based employment decisions taken pursuant to the terms of any bona fide employee benefit plan, such as a retirement, pension, or insurance plan, which is not a subterfuge to evade the purposes of the Age Discrimination in Employment Act of 1967 (ADEA) (29 USCS 621 et seq.) are exempt from the prohibitions of the ADEA, which forbids arbitrary discrimination by public and private employers against employees on account of age. Before the ADEA was made applicable to the states in 1974, the state of Ohio established for state and local government employees a retirement plan under which retirees receive either age-and-service benefits or disability benefits, employees are required to be under 60 years of age upon retirement to qualify for disability benefits, and once an individual retires on either age-and-service or disability benefits, he or she continues to receive that type of benefit throughout retirement, regardless of age. In 1976, the plan was amended to provide that disability payments would in no event constitute less than 30 percent of a disability retiree's final average salary, but no such floor was applied to age-and-service payments. An employee who was covered by the plan and who, because she was no longer able to perform adequately in any employment capacity, retired in 1985 at the age of 61 was denied disability retirement benefits because of her age and was instead granted age-and-service retirement benefits amounting to $ 158.50 per month. The employee, who would have received some $ 355 per month had she been permitted to receive disability benefits subject to the 30-percent floor, filed an age discrimination charge against the plan with the Equal Employment Opportunity Commission (EEOC) and filed suit in the United States District Court for the Southern District of Ohio, claiming that the refusal to grant her application for disability benefits violated the ADEA. The District Court granted summary judgment in favor of the employee, holding that, because the retirement plan's reduction in available benefits at age 60 was not shown to be justified by considerations of increased cost, the plan was not entitled to claim the protection of the 623(f)(2) exemption. The United States Court of Appeals for the Sixth Circuit, holding that the 623(f)(2) exemption is available only to those retirement plans that can provide age-related cost justifications or a substantial business purpose for any age-based reduction in benefits, affirmed the District Court's judgment (848 F2d 692).",lexis

"In the late 19th century, Utah Lake, a navigable body of water, was included within the boundaries of Utah Territory. After a portion of the Sundry Appropriations Act of 1888 (""the 1888 Act"") (25 Stat 505) authorized the United States to select and reserve federal land as sites for reservoirs, the Federal Government in 1889 took several actions--whose nature and effect were to be disputed--with respect to Utah Lake. In a portion of the Sundry Appropriations Act of 1890 (""the 1890 Act"") (predecessor to 43 USCS 662), Congress repealed the 1888 Act's reservoir-site provisions, but added that reservoir sites previously located or selected under the 1888 Act would remain segregated and reserved from entry or settlement.

The state of Utah then brought suit against the United States in the United States District Court for the District of Utah, and sought a judgment that the state, rather than the Federal Government, had title to the bed of Utah lake. The District Court, however, granted a summary judgment in favor of the United States, expressing the view that (1) as part of an 1889 reservoir-site selection, the United States had withdrawn the bed of Utah Lake pursuant to the 1888 Act; (2) because of this prior withdrawal, title to the lakebed did not pass to Utah, which otherwise would have been permitted, on an equal footing with the original states, to obtain title to the lands under navigable waters within the state upon Utah's entry into the Union; and (3) federal title to the bed of Utah Lake was not affected by Congress' subsequent passage of the Submerged Lands Act (43 USCS 1301 et seq.), which relinquished to the states title to some, but not all, federal submerged lands (624 F Supp 622).

"Acting within the provisions of a Texas venue statute, a receiver for a Texas insurance company in liquidation in the Ninety-eighth District Court of Travis County, Texas, brought suit in that court against two national banks and 143 other parties, alleging a conspiracy to defraud the insurance company. Each national bank filed a plea of privilege asserting that it was located in Dallas County, Texas, and therefore was immune from suit in Travis County by virtue of Revised Statutes 5198, which is now incorporated in 12 USC 94, and provides that suits against a national bank may be had in any state or county court in the county in which the bank is located having jurisdiction in similar cases. The pleas were overruled, but the Austin Court of Civil Appeals of the Third Supreme Judicial District reversed. (331 SW2d 349.) The Supreme Court of Texas reversed the judgment of the Court of Civil Appeals and affirmed the judgment of the trial court on the grounds that (1) 94, being permissive and not mandatory, does not prohibit a suit against a national bank when a state venue statute expressly permits it, and (2) 94 has been repealed.

"The lower court applied an improper standard of review to the state court's decision where it blamed counsel for abandoning the not guilty by reason of insanity defense because there was nothing to lose by pursuing it. However, it was not an unreasonable application of clearly established federal law for a state court to decline to apply a specific legal rule that had not been squarely established by the United States Supreme Court. The Court had never established anything akin to the nothing to lose standard for evaluating Strickland claims. Under the doubly deferential judicial review that applied to a Strickland claim evaluated under the _ 2254(d)(1) standard, the prisoner's ineffective assistance of counsel claim failed as it was not unreasonable for the state court to conclude that his defense counsel's performance was not deficient when he counseled the prisoner to abandon a claim that stood almost no chance of success. Case law did not require defense counsel to pursue every claim or defense, regardless of its merit, viability, or realistic chance for success. Thus, the denial of the ineffective assistance of counsel claim did not violate clearly established federal law.",lexis

"In 1994, the Missouri legislature enacted a statute to restrict the permissible amounts of monetary contributions to candidates for state office. The statute took effect in 1995, after a ballot initiative with even stricter contribution limits--although approved by 74 percent of Missouri voters--had been invalidated as violative of the Federal Constitution's First Amendment by the United States Court of Appeals for the Eighth Circuit, which had nevertheless noted alleged improprieties with respect to contributions to Missouri political figures (72 F3d 633, cert den 518 US 1033, 135 L Ed 2d 1094, 116 S Ct 2579). The statute provided, among other matters, that (1) with respect to elections for statewide offices, including state auditor, the amount of contributions made by or accepted from any person other than the candidate was not to exceed 1,000; (2) contributions to candidates for some other state offices were to be limited to as little as 250; and (3) the statutory dollar amounts were to be adjusted each even-numbered year by taking into account the consumer price index. Thus, as of 1998, the limit was adjusted to 1,075 for contributions to candidates for statewide office, while the limit on contributions to candidates for some other state offices was adjusted to 275. A political action committee (PAC) gave a candidate for state auditor 1,025 in 1997 and another 50 in 1998. The PAC, alleging that it would have contributed more to the candidate's campaign but for the limitation--and the candidate, alleging that he could campaign effectively only with more generous contributions than those allowed by the statute--brought suit in the United States District Court for the Eastern District of Missouri against various Missouri officials to enjoin enforcement of the statute as assertedly violating the Federal Constitution's First and Fourteenth Amendments. The District Court, in granting summary judgment in favor of the officials, (1) cited evidence including (a) an affidavit from a Missouri state senator--the co-chair of the legislature's campaign finance reform committee at the time that the contribution limits were enacted--who said that large contributions had the real potential to buy votes, and (b) newspaper reports supporting inferences of impropriety with respect to contributions to Missouri political figures; (2) found adequate support for the statute in the proposition that large contributions raised suspicions of influence peddling that tended to undermine citizens' confidence in the integrity of government; and (3) concluded that the case was controlled by Buckley v Valeo (1976) 424 US 1, 46 L Ed 2d 659, 96 S Ct 612, in which the United States Supreme Court had upheld the constitutionality of a federal statute establishing a 1,000 limitation on contributions to any single candidate for federal office (5 F Supp 2d 734). However, the Court of Appeals (1) enjoined enforcement of the law pending appeal (151 F3d 763); and (2) ultimately reversed and ordered a remand, as the Court of Appeals reasoned in part that Missouri's claim of a compelling interest in avoiding the corruption or the perception of corruption with respect to large campaign contributions was insufficient by itself to satisfy the requisite strict scrutiny (161 F3d 519, reh, en banc, den 1999 US App LEXIS 5241).",lexis
"Congress passed the Natural Gas Act in 1938 to regulate the transportation and sale of natural gas in interstate commerce.

S. C. ¬ß717f(e). As originally enacted, the NGA did not provide a mechanism for certificate holders to secure property rights necessary to build pipelines, often leaving certificate holders with only an illusory right to build. Congress remedied this defect in 1947 by amending the NGA to authorize certificate holders to exercise the federal eminent domain power, thereby ensuring that certificates of public convenience and necessity could be given effect. See ¬ß717f(h). FERC granted petitioner PennEast Pipeline Co. a certificate of public convenience and necessity authorizing construction of a 116-mile pipeline from Pennsylvania to New Jersey. Several parties, including respondent New Jersey, petitioned for review of FERC‚Äôs order in the D. C. Circuit. The D. C.

The Third Circuit vacated the District Court‚Äôs order insofar as it awarded PennEast relief with respect to New Jersey‚Äôs property interests.

Alabama responded that Madison had a rational understanding of the reasons for his execution, even assuming he had no memory of committing his crime. And more broadly, the State claimed that Madison failed to implicate Ford and Panetti because both decisions concerned themselves with gross delusions, which Madison did not have. Following a competency hearing, the trial court found Madison competent to be executed. On federal habeas review, this Court summarily reversed the Eleventh Circuit's grant of relief, holding that, under the ‚Äúdemanding‚Äù and ‚Äúdeferential standard‚Äù of the Antiterrorism and Effective Death Penalty Act of 1996 (AEDPA), ‚Äú[n]either Panetti nor Ford ‚Äòclearly established‚Äô that a prisoner is incompetent to be executed‚Äù because of a simple failure to remember his crime.

"Prior to acquiring through merger various railroad lines, including the line on which the plaintiffs were employees, the defendant railroad entered into an agreement with several labor unions for the protection of the employees on the railroad lines which were to be acquired. The agreement provided that the employees of these lines would not be adversely affected in their employment as a result of the merger, and specific provisions were included for compensation of those employees, including the plaintiffs, whose postmerger earnings would be lower than their premerger earnings. In its order approving the merger, the Interstate Commerce Commission stated that the agreement respecting the rights of the employees was made pursuant to and in conformity with 5(2)(f) of the Interstate Commerce Act, which provides that as a condition to the Commission's approval of a railroad merger, the Commission shall require a fair and equitable arrangement to protect the interests of the employees affected by the merger, and that in the order of approval of the merger, the Commission shall include terms and conditions providing that the merger will not result in such employees being in a worse position with respect to their employment. After the merger went into effect, the plaintiffs were not paid the compensation promised, and when they were about to obtain arbitration, their union and the defendant entered into a new agreement which reduced substantially the compensation payable to the plaintiffs. The union refused to arbitrate the plaintiffs' claim that they were entitled to the compensation provided under the premerger agreement, and the plaintiffs then sued for damages in the United States District Court for the Northern District of Ohio. The District Court held the postmerger agreement invalid and upheld the plaintiffs' right of action (287 F Supp 221, 309 F Supp 575).

"The Telecommunications Act of 1996 requires incumbent local exchange carriers (LECs)‚Äîi.e., providers of local telephone service‚Äîto share their physical networks with competitive LECs at cost-based rates in two ways relevant here. First, 47 U. S. C. ¬ß251(c)(3) requires an incumbent LEC to lease ‚Äúon an unbundled basis‚Äù‚Äîi.e., a la carte‚Äînetwork elements specified by the Federal Communications Commission (FCC) to allow a competitor to create its own network without having to build every element from scratch. In identifying those elements, the FCC must consider whether access is ‚Äúnecessary‚Äù and whether failing to provide it would ‚Äúimpair‚Äù the competitor‚Äôs provision of service. ¬ß251(d)(2). Second, ¬ß251(c)(2) mandates that incumbent LECs ‚Äúprovide ‚Ä¶ interconnection‚Äù between their networks and competitive LECs‚Äô to ensure that a competitor‚Äôs customers can call the incumbent‚Äôs customers, and vice versa. The interconnection duty is independent of the unbundling rules and not subject to impairment analysis. In 2003, the FCC issued its Triennial Review Order deciding, contrary to previous orders, that ¬ß251(c)(3) did not require an incumbent LEC to provide a competitive LEC with cost-based unbundled access to existing ‚Äúentrance facilities‚Äù‚Äîi.e., transmission facilities (typically wires or cables) that connect the two LECs‚Äô networks‚Äîbecause such facilities are not network elements at all. The FCC noted, however, that entrance facilities are used for both interconnection and backhauling, and it emphasized that its order did not alter incumbent LECs‚Äô ¬ß251(c)(2) obligation to provide for interconnection. Thus, the practical effect of the order was only that incumbent LECs were not obligated to unbundle entrance facilities for backhauling purposes. In 2005, following D. C. Circuit review, the FCC issued its Triennial Review Remand Order. The FCC retreated from the view that entrance facilities are not network elements, but adhered to its previous position that cost-based unbundled access to such facilities need not be provided under ¬ß251(c)(3). Treating entrance facilities as network elements, the FCC concluded that competitive LECs are not impaired without access to such facilities. The FCC again emphasized that competitive LECs‚Äô ¬ß251(c)(2) right to obtain interconnection had not been altered. In the Remand Order‚Äôs wake, respondent AT&T notified competitive LECs that it would no longer provide entrance facilities at cost-based rates for either backhauling or interconnection, but would instead charge higher rates. Competitive LECs complained to the Michigan Public Service Commission that AT&T was unlawfully abrogating their ¬ß251(c)(2) right to cost-based interconnection. The Michigan Public Service Commission agreed and ordered AT&T to continue providing entrance facilities for interconnection at cost-based rates. AT&T challenged the ruling. Relying on the Remand Order, the Federal District Court ruled in AT&T‚Äôs favor. The Sixth Circuit affirmed, declining to defer to the FCC‚Äôs argument that the order did not change incumbent LECs‚Äô interconnection obligations, including the obligation to lease entrance facilities for interconnection.",lexis
"A tenth grade student left school without permission and, with four other students, consumed alcohol and became intoxicated. When he returned to school later that day to go on a band trip, he was notified that he was suspended from school.

The student immediately sought injunctive relief under 42 USCS 1983 in the United States District Court forthe Western District of Arkansas, which decided that the school board had violated the student's right to substantive due process. The District Court found that the board had acted under one of its rules, which provides for mandatory suspension of students who, on school premises, use, sell, are under the influence of, or possess narcotics or other hallucinogenics, drugs, or controlled substances, and concluded that alcohol is not included in any of these categories and that, therefore, the board had acted unreasonably by suspending the student under the rule.

"A military doctor who was working at a United States Army hospital in Italy served as attending physician to an Army sergeant's wife during the delivery of the couple's son. In 1987, the couple filed a federal diversity suit against the doctor in the United States District Court for the Central District of California and alleged that the doctor's negligence during the delivery caused the son to be born with massive brain damage. The Federal Government (1) sought to have itself substituted for the doctor as the defendant pursuant to the Gonzalez Act, which provides, in 10 USCS 1089(a), that, in suits against military medical personnel for torts committed within the scope of their employment, (a) the Federal Government is to be substituted as the defendant, and (b) the suit is to proceed against the Federal Government under the Federal Tort Claims Act (FTCA) (28 USCS 2671 et seq.); and (2) argued that action should be dismissed, because (a) the action had arisen overseas, and (b) therefore, Federal Government liability was precluded by the FTCA's exception (28 USCS 2680(k)) excluding recovery for injuries sustained abroad. The District Court granted the Federal Government's motion for substitution and dismissed the action. While the couple's appeal was pending, Congress enacted the Federal Employees Liability Reform and Tort Compensation Act of 1988 (the 1988 Act), which (1) was made applicable to all proceedings pending on the date of enactment; and (2) generally provided, in 28 USCS 2679(b)(1), that the remedy against the United States under the FTCA is exclusive of any other civil action or proceeding for money damages by persons injured by Federal Government employees acting within the scope of their employment. The United States Court of Appeals for the Ninth Circuit, however, in reversing and remanding, expressed the view that neither the Gonzalez Act nor the 1988 Act required the Federal Government's substitution as the defendant in the case at hand or otherwise immunized the doctor in question from liability, because (1) the Gonzalez Act (a) made the FTCA the exclusive remedy only for malpractice committed by stateside military medical personnel, and (b) left foreign-based military medical personnel like the doctor subject to malpractice liability; and (2) the 1988 Act's exclusive remedy (a) applied only when the FTCA in fact provided a remedy, and (b) thus, did not apply in the case at hand, as a result of 2680(k)'s exclusion of any FTCA remedy (885 F2d 650).",lexis
"In January 2019, the Department of Homeland Security began to implement the Migrant Protection Protocols (MPP). Under MPP, certain non-Mexican nationals arriving by land from Mexico were returned to Mexico to await the results of their removal proceedings under section 1229a of the Immigration and Nationality Act (INA). MPP was implemented pursuant to a provision of the INA that applies to aliens ‚Äúarriving on land . . . from a foreign territory contiguous to the United States‚Äù and provides that the Secretary of Homeland Security ‚Äúmay return the alien to that territory pending a proceeding under section 1229a.‚Äù 8 U. S. C. ¬ß1225(b)(2)(C). Following a change in Presidential administrations, the Biden administration announced that it would suspend the program, and on June 1, 2021, the Secretary of Homeland Security issued a memorandum officially terminating it. The States of Texas and Missouri (respondents) brought suit in the Northern District of Texas against the Secretary and others, asserting that the June 1 Memorandum violated the INA and the Administrative Procedure Act (APA). The District Court entered judgment for respondents. The court first concluded that terminating MPP would violate the INA, reasoning that section 1225 of the INA ‚Äúprovides the government two options‚Äù with respect to illegal entrants: mandatory detention pursuant to section 1225(b)(2)(A) or contiguous-territory return pursuant to section 1225(b)(2)(C). 554 F. Supp. 3d 818, 852. Because the Government was unable to meet its mandatory detention obligations under section 1225(b)(2)(A) due to resource constraints, the court reasoned, terminating MPP would necessarily lead to the systemic violation of section 1225 as illegal entrants were released into the United States. Second, the District Court concluded that the June 1 Memorandum was arbitrary and capricious in violation of the APA. The District Court vacated the June 1 Memorandum and remanded to DHS. It also imposed a nationwide injunction ordering the Government to ‚Äúenforce and implement MPP in good faith until such a time as it has been lawfully rescinded in compliance with the APA and until such a time as the federal government has sufficient detention capacity to detain all aliens subject to mandatory detention under [section 1225] without releasing any aliens because of a lack of detention resources.‚Äù Id., at 857 (emphasis in original). While the Government‚Äôs appeal was pending, the Secretary released the October 29 Memoranda, which again announced the termination of MPP and explained anew his reasons for doing so. The Government then moved to vacate the injunction on the ground that the October 29 Memoranda had superseded the June 1 Memorandum. But the Court of Appeals denied the motion and instead affirmed the District Court‚Äôs judgment in full. With respect to the INA question, the Court of Appeals agreed with the District Court‚Äôs analysis that terminating the program would violate the INA, concluding that the return policy was mandatory so long as illegal entrants were being released into the United States.

There was a strong presumption that the lodestar figure was reasonable, but that presumption could have been overcome in those rare circumstances in which the lodestar did not adequately take into account a factor that properly may have been considered in determining a reasonable fee. The Supreme Court found that there were a few circumstances in which superior attorney performance was not adequately taken into account in the lodestar calculation, but these circumstances were rare and exceptional, and required specific evidence that the lodestar fee would not have been adequate to attract competent counsel.

More than 3 years later, a passenger of the car who had been injured in the collision brought a negligence action in the Ashtabula County Court of Common Pleas against the truck driver and its owner. The truck driver was a resident of Pennsylvania, and the owner was a Pennsylvania corporation which was not licensed to do business in Ohio. At the time of the collision, the limitations period for personal injury actions was 2 years; however, an Ohio statute tolled the running of such period for claims against out-of-state defendants.

At a conference preceding the penalty phase of the trial, one of the accused's attorneys (1) moved for an order prohibiting the prosecution from cross-examining defense witnesses with regard to the accused's juvenile record; and (2) requested that the jury be instructed on the statutory mitigating circumstance that the accused had no significant history of prior criminal activity, even though the attorney also stated that she would not try to show that the accused lacked a criminal past.

"Pre-1988 Medicaid eligibility rules for married applicants often required both spouses to deplete their combined resources before a spouse who was institutionalized, as in a nursing home, became eligible for benefits. In order to prevent the pauperization of the ""community spouse""--that is, the spouse remaining at home--the Medicare Catastrophic Coverage Act of 1988 (MCCA) (42 USCS 1396r-5 et seq.) (1) directed that, in any month in which one spouse was institutionalized, no income of the community spouse was to be deemed available to the institutionalized spouse ( 1396r-5(b)(1)); (2) required states to set a ""minimum monthly maintenance needs allowance"" (MMMNA) for the community spouse ( 1396r-5(d)(3)); and (3) prescribed that, if the community spouse's posteligibility income was insufficient to yield income equal to or above the MMMNA, the shortfall--called the ""community spouse monthly income allowance"" (CSMIA)--could be deducted from the institutionalized spouse's income and paid to the community spouse ( 1396r-5(d)(1)(B)). In determining the institutionalized spouse's Medicaid eligibility, a portion of the couple's resources--called the ""community spouse resource allowance"" (CSRA)--was to be reserved for the benefit of the community spouse ( 1396r-5(c)(2)). Under 1396r-5(e)(2)(C), a couple could obtain a higher CSRA by establishing that the standard CSRA was inadequate to raise ""the community spouse's income"" to the MMMNA. An administrative hearing for such a purpose was authorized by 1396r-5(e)(2)(A)(v). To calculate the CSRA at such a hearing, some states used an ""income-first"" method, under which the state considered whether the community spouse's income, including potential CSMIA transfers from the institutionalized spouse, would suffice to enable the community spouse to meet monthly needs once the institutionalized spouse qualified for Medicaid. Other states used a ""resources-first"" method that excluded such potential income transfers from consideration. After entering a Wisconsin nursing home, a wife applied for Medicaid. The Green County, Wisconsin, department of human services (1) determined (using figures as subsequently corrected somewhat) that the wife and her husband could retain $ 74,822 in assets--$ 72,822 as the husband's standard CSRA and $ 2,000 as the wife's personal allowance; (2) found that, as of the date of the application, the couple possessed resources exceeding their $ 74,822 limit by $ 14,513; and (3) concluded that the wife would not be eligible for Medicaid until the couple's spending reduced their resources by the $ 14,513 amount. The wife sought a hearing before Wisconsin's department of health and family services in order to obtain a higher CSRA for the husband, on the grounds that the husband's monthly income fell below the applicable MMMNA. The hearing examiner, applying a Wisconsin statute that adopted the income-first rule, concluded that he lacked authority to increase the CSRA. Wisconsin's Department of Industry, Labor and Human Relations affirmed the hearing examiner's decision, and the Circuit Court for Green County affirmed. However, the Wisconsin Court of Appeals--in reversing the Circuit Court's order and in directing a remand--concluded that (1) the MCCA mandated the resources-first method, and (2) Wisconsin's income-first statute thus conflicted with the MCCA (2000 WI App 150, 237 Wis 2d 810, 615 NW2d 647).",lexis

The defendants moved to dismiss the remaining counts on the ground that the superseding indictment manifested prosecutorial vindictiveness. The United States District Court for the Central District of California denied the defendants' motion, but stayed the commencement of the trial to permit an appeal. The United States Court of Appeals for the Ninth Circuit, ruling that the denial of a motion to dismiss based on the ground of vindictive prosecution is immediately appealable as a final decision under 28 USCS 1291, held that the defendants established a case of prosecutorial vindictiveness requiring dismissal of the superseding indictment (646 F2d 384).",lexis

"An accused--who had (1) begun serving a life sentence after a Georgia conviction for murder, (2) escaped from prison, and (3) committed another murder--was apprehended, convicted of the second murder, and sentenced to a second life term. At the time the accused committed his second offense, the state's board of pardons and paroles required reconsiderations of parole to take place every 3 years following an initial consideration after 7 years. After the accused had begun serving his second life sentence, the parole board, acting under statutory authority, amended its rules to provide that reconsideration of those inmates serving life sentences who have been denied parole would take place at least every 8 years. The parole board (1) considered the accused for parole 7 years after the second conviction, (2) denied release, and (3) consistent with the amended rule, set reconsideration for 8 years later. The United States Court of Appeals for the Eleventh Circuit, in another case, held that retroactive application of the amended rule violated the prohibition on ex post facto laws contained in Art I, 10, cl 1 of the Federal Constitution. In compliance with that decision, the parole board reconsidered the accused's case in 3-year intervals, with parole being denied each time. Subsequently, the parole board (1) determined that the United States Supreme Court's decision in California Dep't of Corrections v Morales (1995) 514 US 499, 131 L Ed 2d 588, 115 S Ct 1597, had rejected the rationale underlying the Court of Appeals decision in the other case, and (2) set the accused's next consideration for 8 years after his most recent review. The accused brought an action in the United States District Court for the Northern District of Georgia against individual members of the parole board, which action claimed that the amended rule violated the Constitution's ex post facto law prohibition. The District Court (1) denied the accused's motion for leave to conduct discovery to support his claim, (2) entered summary judgment for the defendants, and (3) expressed the view that the amendment to the parole board rule changed only the timing between reconsideration hearings for inmates sentenced to life in prison, thereby relieving the board of the necessity of holding parole hearings for prisoners who had no reasonable chance of being released. The Court of Appeals for the Eleventh Circuit reversed the judgment of the District Court and expressed the view that (1) the amended rule's retroactive application was necessarily an ex post facto violation, and (2) a parole board policy which permitted inmates, upon a showing of a change in ""their circumstance"" or where the board received new information, to receive expedited reconsideration for parole was insufficient (164 F.3d 589).",lexis

"The Hague Convention on the Civil Aspects of International Child Ab- duction (Hague Convention or Convention), implemented in the United States by the International Child Abduction Remedies Act, 22 U. S. C. §9001 et seq., provides that a child wrongfully removed from her country of “habitual residence” ordinarily must be returned to that country.
Petitioner Monasky, a U. S. citizen, asserts that her Italian hus- band, respondent Taglieri, became abusive after the couple moved to Italy from the United States. Two months after the birth of the cou- ple’s daughter, A. M. T., in Italy, Monasky fled with the infant to Ohio. Taglieri petitioned the U. S. District Court for the Northern District of Ohio for A. M. T.’s return to Italy under the Convention, pursuant to 22 U. S. C. §9003(b), on the ground that the child had been wrongfully removed from her country of “habitual residence.” The District Court granted Taglieri’s petition, concluding that the parents’ shared intent was for their daughter to live in Italy. Then two-year-old A. M. T. was returned to Italy. The en banc Sixth Circuit affirmed. Under its prec- edent, the court first noted, an infant’s habitual residence depends on the parents’ shared intent. It then reviewed the District Court’s habitual-residence determination for clear error and found none. In doing so, the court rejected Monasky’s argument that Italy could not qualify as A. M. T.’s “habitual residence” in the absence of an actual agreement by her parents to raise her there.",lexis

The organizations, on the basis of arbitration clauses in the contracts in question, moved to compel arbitration. The District Court, in refusing this request for the RICO claims, concluded that the arbitration clauses were unenforceable because (1) the clauses prohibited awards of ""punitive damages,"" and (2) thus, the physicians might not have been able obtain meaningful relief in arbitration, since 18 USCS 1964(c) authorized treble damages under RICO (132 F Supp 2d 989).

"The main channel of the Missouri River, the middle of which forms the Missouri-Nebraska boundary line, shifted so that certain bottom land, once an island in the river, was on the Missouri side rather than on the Nebraska side of the boundary. Two Nebraska citizens, who claimed the land by virtue of a Nebraska sheriff's tax foreclosure deed, brought suit in a Nebraska state court against a Missouri citizen who claimed the land by virtue of a Missouri swampland patent. A principal issue litigated was whether the shift in the river's course resulted from avulsion, so that under Nebraska law the land remained a part of Nebraska, or from accretion, so that under Nebraska law the land became a part of Missouri. The Nebraska court found that the shift in the river's course resulted from avulsion, that it had jurisdiction of the parties and of the subject matter, and that the land was in Nebraska, and it quieted title in the Nebraska citizens. The Supreme Court of Nebraska affirmed, and the Missouri citizen did not seek review in the Supreme Court of the United States. Instead, the Missouri citizen brought a similar action against the Nebraska citizens in a Missouri state court, from whence it was removed to the United States District Court for the Western District of Missouri, which dismissed the suit on the ground that the Nebraska judgment was res judicata and binding on the court.

"More than 30 years ago, Vernon Madison crept up behind police officer Julius Schulte and shot him twice in the head at close range. An Alabama jury found Madison guilty of *11 capital murder. The trial court sentenced him to death. See Ex parte Madison, 718 So.2d 104, 105‚Äì106 (1998).
In 2016, as Madison's execution neared, he petitioned the trial court for a suspension of his death sentence. He argued that, due to several recent strokes, he has become incompetent to be executed. The court held a hearing to receive testimony from two psychologists who had examined Madison and prepared reports concerning his competence. The court's appointed psychologist, Dr. Karl Kirkland, reported that, although Madison may have ‚Äúsuffered a significant decline post-stroke, ... [he] understands the exact posture of his case at this point,‚Äù and appears to have a ‚Äúrational understanding of ... the results or effects‚Äù of his death sentence. App. to Pet. for Cert. 75a (internal quotation marks omitted); Madison v. Commissioner, Ala. Dept. of Corrections, 851 F.3d 1173, 1193 (C.A.11 2017) (internal quotation marks omitted). Asked at the hearing whether Madison understands that Alabama is seeking retribution against him for his criminal act, Dr. Kirkland answered, ‚ÄúCertainly.‚Äù Id., at 1180 (internal quotation marks omitted).
Dr. John Goff, a psychologist hired by Madison's counsel, reported that Madison's strokes have rendered him unable to remember ‚Äúnumerous events that have occurred over the past thirty years or more.‚Äù App. to Pet. for Cert. 77a. Nevertheless, Dr. Goff found that Madison ‚Äúis able to understand the nature of the pending proceeding and he has an understanding of what he was tried for‚Äù; that he knows he is ‚Äúin prison ... because of ‚Äòmurder‚Äô ‚Äù; that he ‚Äúunderstands that ... [Alabama is] seeking retribution‚Äù for that crime; and that he ‚Äúunderstands the sentence, specifically the meaning of a death sentence.‚Äù **11 Id., at 76a‚Äì78a (some internal quotation marks omitted). In Dr. Goff's opinion, however, Madison does not ‚Äúunderstan[d] the act that ... he is being punished for‚Äù because he cannot recall ‚Äúthe sequence of events from the offense to his arrest to the trial or any of those *12 details‚Äù and believes that he ‚Äúnever went around killing folks.‚Äù Ibid. (internal quotation marks omitted).
The trial court denied Madison's petition. It held that, under this Court's decisions in Ford v. Wainwright, 477 U.S. 399, 106 S.Ct. 2595, 91 L.Ed.2d 335 (1986), and Panetti v. Quarterman, 551 U.S. 930, 127 S.Ct. 2842, 168 L.Ed.2d 662 (2007), Madison was entitled to relief if he could show that he ‚Äúsuffers from a mental illness which deprives [him] of the mental capacity to rationally understand that he is being executed as a punishment for a crime.‚Äù App. to Pet. for Cert. 74a. The court concluded that Madison had failed to make that showing. Specifically, it found that Madison understands ‚Äúthat he is going to be executed because of the murder he committed[,] ... that the State is seeking retribution[,] and that he will die when he is executed.‚Äù Id., at 82a.

Madison then filed a petition for a writ of habeas corpus in Federal District Court. As a state prisoner, Madison is entitled to federal habeas relief under the Antiterrorism and Effective Death Penalty Act of 1996 (AEDPA) only if the state trial court's adjudication of his incompetence claim ‚Äúwas contrary to, or involved an unreasonable application of, clearly established Federal law, as determined by‚Äù this Court, or else was ‚Äúbased on an unreasonable determination of the facts in light of the evidence presented‚Äù in state court. 28 U.S.C. ¬ß 2254(d). A habeas petitioner meets this demanding standard only when he shows that the state court's decision was ‚Äúso lacking in justification that there was an error well understood and comprehended in existing law beyond any possibility for fairminded disagreement.‚Äù Harrington v. Richter, 562 U.S. 86, 103, 131 S.Ct. 770, 178 L.Ed.2d 624 (2011). The District Court denied Madison's petition after concluding that the state court ‚Äúcorrectly applied Ford and Panetti ‚Äù and did not make an ‚Äúunreasonable determination of the facts in light of the evidence.‚Äù App. to Pet. for Cert. 67a.
The Eleventh Circuit granted a certificate of appealability and, on appeal, reversed over Judge Jordan's dissent. In the majority's view, given the undisputed fact that Madison ‚Äúhas *13 no memory of his capital offense,‚Äù it inescapably follows that he ‚Äúdoes not rationally understand the connection between his crime and his execution.‚Äù 851 F.3d, at 1185‚Äì1186. On that basis, the Eleventh Circuit held that the trial court's conclusion that Madison is competent to be executed was ‚Äúplainly unreasonable‚Äù and ‚Äúcannot be reconciled with any reasonable application of Panetti.‚Äù Id., at 1187‚Äì1188 (internal quotation marks omitted).",lexis

"Under 26 USCS 6321, a federal lien attaches to all property and rights to property belonging to any taxpayer who fails to pay federal taxes owed by the taxpayer. When a husband failed to pay income tax liabilities assessed against him by the Internal Revenue Service (IRS), the Federal Government filed a lien that sought to attach, under 6321, the husband's properties that included a piece of real property in Michigan that the husband and his wife held under Michigan law as tenants by the entireties. After the notice of the lien was filed, the husband and wife executed a quitclaim deed that purported to transfer to the wife the husband's interest in the real property. Subsequently, when the wife was attempting to sell the property, the IRS agreed to release the lien with a stipulation that half of the net proceeds of the sale be held in escrow, pending determination of the Federal Government's interest in the property. In an action by the wife to quiet title to the escrowed proceeds, the United States District Court for the Western District of Michigan, granting the government's motion for summary judgment, held that the lien entitled the government to half of the property's value. On appeal by both parties, the United States Court of Appeals for the Sixth Circuit, remanding to the District Court to consider an alternative claim by the government, expressed the view that the lien did not attach to the property because under Michigan law, the husband had no separate interest in property held as a tenant by the entirety (140 F3d 638). After the District Court, on remand, awarded the IRS a share of the proceeds of the sale (65 F Supp 2d 651), both parties again appealed, with the government again asserting that its lien attached to the husband's interest in the entireties property. The Court of Appeals, affirming the District Court's decision concerning the government's alternative claim, held that the Court of Appeals' earlier decision in the instant case was the law of the case on the issue of whether the lien under 6321 attached (233 F3d 358).",lexis

On two occasions, the plaintiff had stopped distributing handbills on an exterior sidewalk at the shopping center when warned by police that he would be arrested if he refused to stop or if he resumed handbilling, one of the plaintiff's companions having been arrested and charged with violating the state statute when she continued handbilling. The District Court denied relief for lack of an active controversy, since there was no showing that the state was acting in bad faith (334 F Supp 1386). On the plaintiff's appeal from the denial of declaratory relief only, the United States Court of Appeals for the Fifth Circuit affirmed the District Court's judgment denying declaratory relief, holding that the principles of Younger v Harris, 401 US 37, 27 L Ed 2d 669, 91 S Ct 746, and Samuels v Mackell, 401 US 66, 27 L Ed 2d 688, 91 S Ct 764--which required that bad faith enforcement or other special circumstances must be established in order to obtain either declaratory or injunctive relief in a federal court against a pending state court criminal prosecution under a challenged state criminal statute--were also applicable when a state prosecution was threatened but not pending (459 F2d 919).",lexis

After protracted litigation on the merits of a challenge to the Immigration and Naturalization Service's actions with respect to Haitian immigrants, the United States District Court for the Southern District of Florida, in determining that the plaintiffs in the case were entitled to a fee award under the EAJA, expressly found that (1) the plaintiffs were the prevailing parties within the meaning of the EAJA; (2) the Federal Government's position was not substantially justified; and (3) there were no other special circumstances that would make an award unjust (624 F Supp 836). Subsequently, the District Court held that the plaintiffs were entitled to an award for the fees, costs, and expenses incurred during the litigation as to the proper EAJA fee (646 F Supp 1300). On appeal, the United States Court of Appeals for the Eleventh Circuit, although deciding that certain errors required that the case be remanded for recalculation of attorney's fees and expenses, (1) upheld the three District Court findings with respect to the plaintiffs' entitlement to an EAJA award; and (2) expressed the view that the District Court did not err in awarding attorney's fees for the EAJA fee litigation, even though the District Court had made no determination that the Federal Government's position in the fee litigation itself was without substantial justification (863 F2d 759).",lexis

The veteran's EAJA application failed to include the statutorily required allegation that the Secretary's position was not substantially justified, and the veteran's amendment of the application to include the allegation was not accomplished prior to expiration of the statutory period for filing the application. The veteran contended that the amendment cured the defect in the otherwise timely application, but the Secretary argued that no proper application was filed within the required time. The United States Supreme Court held that the curative amendment was permissible after the filing period expired and the veteran's application, as amended, qualified for consideration and determination on the merits. The required allegation that the Secretary's position was not substantially justified was merely a pleading burden to discourage irresponsible litigation, rather than an essential notice of the Secretary's well established burden of proving substantial justification.

"These cases presented questions as to procedures required at state prison disciplinary hearings. In case No. 74-1194, inmates of a California penal institution filed an action for declaratory and injunctive relief under 42 USCS 1983 in the United States District Court for the Northern District of California, alleging that the procedures used in prison disciplinary proceedings violated their Fourteenth Amendment rights. The District Court granted substantial relief (328 F Supp 767), and the United States Court of Appeals for the Ninth Circuit, after originally modifying the District Court's judgment in part, affirming in part, and remanding the case (497 F2d 809), reaffirmed its original judgment and modified its opinion on rehearing, holding that minimum notice and a right to respond were due an inmate faced even with a temporary suspension of privileges, that an inmate at a disciplinary hearing who was denied the privilege of confronting and cross-examining witnesses must receive written reasons for such denial, and that an inmate facing prison discipline for a violation that might also be punishable in state criminal proceedings had a right to counsel (510 F2d 613). In case No. 74-1187, an action for damages and injunctive relief under 42 USCS 1983 was instituted in the United States District Court for the District of Rhode Island by a Rhode Island state prison inmate who contended that his due process rights had been violated by the procedures employed at a prison disciplinary hearing resulting in a decision adverse to the inmate. The prison disciplinary board had informed the inmate that he might be prosecuted for a violation of state law and that he should consult his attorney, but his attorney was not permitted to be present during the hearing; and the inmate remained silent during the hearing, after he had been informed by the board that he had the right to remain silent, but that his silence would be held against him. The District Court denied relief, but the United States Court of Appeals for the First Circuit reversed (487 F2d 1280). However, the United States Supreme Court vacated the Court of Appeals' judgment (418 US 908, 41 L Ed 2d 1155, 94 S Ct 3200), remanding the case for reconsideration in light of an intervening Supreme Court decision in another case. On remand, the Court of Appeals affirmed its prior decision but modified its opinion, holding that an inmate at a disciplinary proceeding must be advised of his right to remain silent, that he must not be questioned further once he exercises such right, that his silence could not be used against him at that time or in future proceedings, and that in cases where criminal charges were a realistic possibility, prison authorities should consider whether defense counsel, if requested, should be allowed at the disciplinary proceeding (510 F2d 534).",lexis

"A Washington state statute authorized the commitment of ""sexually violent predators,"" that is, persons who had been convicted of, or charged with, a crime of sexual violence and who suffered from a mental abnormality or personality disorder that made such persons likely to engage in predatory acts of sexual violence. Pursuant to the statute, an individual who had been imprisoned for rape was committed, at the end of his prison term, as a sexually violent predator and was subsequently confined at a special commitment center. The individual, appealing his commitment, alleged among other matters that the statute violated the Federal Constitution's Art I, 10, cl 1 prohibition against ex post facto laws and the Constitution's Fifth Amendment prohibition against double jeopardy. The Supreme Court of Washington, in affirming the commitment on appeal, determined that the statute (1) was civil rather than criminal, and (2) did not violate the ex post facto and double jeopardy prohibitions (122 Wash 2d 1, 857 P2d 989). The individual then instituted a habeas corpus action under 28 USCS 2254 in the United States District Court for the Western District of Washington against the center's superintendent to seek release from confinement. The District Court initially granted the writ on the ground that the statute was unconstitutional (898 F Supp 744). While the superintendent's appeal was pending, the United States Supreme Court decided Kansas v Hendricks (1997) 521 US 346, 138 L Ed 2d 501, 117 S Ct 2072, in which it was held that a similar commitment scheme under Kansas' sexually violent predator statute was nonpunitive and thus did not violate the ex post facto and double jeopardy prohibitions. Accordingly, the United States Court of Appeals for the Ninth Circuit remanded the case for reconsideration in light of Kansas v Hendricks (122 F.3d 38, 1997 US App LEXIS 20914). On remand, the District Court denied the individual's habeas corpus petition. The Court of Appeals, in reversing and remanding in pertinent part, (1) reasoned that actual confinement conditions could divest a facially valid statute of its civil label upon a showing by the clearest proof that the statutory scheme was punitive in effect, and (2) concluded that further proceedings in the District Court were necessary to determine whether the conditions at the center rendered the statute punitive as applied to the individual (192 F3d 870).",lexis

"Under 2 of the Federal Arbitration Act (FAA) (9 USCS 2), written provisions for arbitration are valid, irrevocable, and enforceable, save upon such grounds as exist at law or in equity for the revocation of any contract. However, a Montana notice statute declared a contract's arbitration clause unenforceable unless notice that the contract was subject to arbitration was typed in underlined capital letters on the first page of the contract. A national franchisor of sandwich shops entered into a standard-form franchise agreement with a franchisee for the operation of a sandwich shop in Montana. On page 9 of the agreement was an arbitration clause in ordinary type. When a dispute arose, the franchisee (1) filed a suit against the franchisor and an agent of the franchisor in the District Court for the Eighth Judicial District in Cascade County, Montana, and (2) alleged state-law contract and tort claims relating to the franchise agreement. The franchisor successfully moved in the District Court to stay the suit pending arbitration. On appeal, the Supreme Court of Montana, in ordering a reversal and remand, left undisturbed the District Court's findings that the franchise agreement fell within the FAA's scope and that the agreement covered the claims at issue, but expressed the view that the Montana notice statute (1) rendered the arbitration clause unenforceable; and (2) was not pre-empted by 2, as the Montana statute did not undermine the FAA's goals and policies by prescribing that before arbitration agreements were enforceable, they had to be entered into knowingly (286 Mont 369, 886 P2d 931). The United States Supreme Court (515 US ____, 132 L Ed 2d 807, 115 S Ct 2552) granted certiorari, vacated, and remanded for further proceedings in light of a recent United States Supreme Court decision in another case involving 2's pre-emption of state law.

"As a result of unsatisfied federal tax liabilities personally incurred by a husband, the Federal Government placed liens on the husband's property, including his interest in a house which he owned jointly with his wife. After the husband deeded his interest in the house to the wife as part of a division of marital property in contemplation of divorce, the wife entered a contract to sell the house. Subsequently, a week before the scheduled closing date for the sale, the government gave the wife and the purchaser actual notice of the liens, which, the government asserted, were valid against the house or the proceeds of the sale. In order to be able to convey clear title to the house, the wife, under protest, authorized disbursement from the sale proceeds of the total of the liens directly to the Internal Revenue Service. After the government denied the wife's claim for an administrative refund, she filed in the United States District Court for the Central District of California a suit under 28 USCS 1346(a)(1)--which authorizes federal courts to adjudicate any civil action against the United States for the recovery of any internal-revenue tax alleged to have been erroneously or illegally assessed or collected--alleging that because, when she received her husband's interest in the house, she lacked notice of the then-existing lien, she had received the property free of such lien. The District Court entered a judgment to the effect that the wife lacked standing to sue for a tax refund under 1346(a)(1) because she was not the assessed party.

"Three different tax refund suits were brought in the United States Court of Claims presenting the question whether the ""percentage depletion"" allowance of 611 and 613 of the Internal Revenue Code of 1954 (26 USCS 611 and 613)--which permits the owner of an economic interest in a mineral deposit a special deduction from taxable income measured by a percentage of his gross income derived from exhaustion of the mineral--must be denied to otherwise eligible lessees of underground coal because their leases were subject to termination by the lessor on 30 days' notice. In each case, the taxpayer operated a coal mine pursuant to a written lease, and in exchange for a fixed royalty per ton, the lessor granted the lessee the right to extract coal and to sell it at prices determined by the lessee. Each lease contained a clause permitting the lessor to terminate the lease on 30 days' notice, but, in fact, none of the lessors exercised that right, each lessee mined a substantial tonnage of coal during an uninterrupted operation that continued for several years, and the proceeds from the sale of the coal represented the only revenue from which the lessees recovered the royalties paid to the lessors.

"The Texas Department of Human Resources, in order to protect certain children who were suspected victims of child abuse and to investigate the extent of any injuries, took temporary custody of the children and instituted a suit in the Harris County Juvenile Court for emergency protection of the children under a Texas Law. The Juvenile Court entered an emergency ex parte order giving temporary custody of the children to the Department. The children's parents later appeared and moved to modify the order, but when the judge was temporarily unavailable, they filed a petition for a writ of habeas corpus in Harris County, rather than renewing the motion or appealing the order. On hearing the petition, the court, concluding that venue was properly in Montgomery County, transferred the proceedings to that county, and at the judge's direction, the Department filed another suit which was also transferred while the judge continued the Department's temporary custody of the children. The parents, instead of making an effort to expedite the hearing in the Montgomery County Juvenile Court or appealing the temporary order, filed an action in the United States District Court for the Southern District of Texas, challenging the constitutionality of the Texas statute which defined the contours of the parent-child relationship and the permissible areas and modes of state intervention. The District Court denied a temporary restraining order, but later held that the temporary order issued by the state court had expired and that the children had to be returned to their parents. The Department then filed a new suit in Montgomery County and the state issued a show cause order and writ of attachment ordering that one of the children be delivered to the temporary custody of his grandparents.

A Maine nonprofit corporation operated a summer camp for the benefit of children of a particular religious group. Because about 95 percent of the campers were not residents of Maine, the corporation could not qualify for the full tax exemption, and because the weekly tuition for the campers was approximately $ 400 per person, the corporation was not eligible for any tax exemption at all.

"Article III, ¬ß1, of the Constitution mandates that ‚Äú[t]he judicial Power of the United States, shall be vested in one supreme Court, and in such inferior Courts as the Congress may from time to time ordain and establish,‚Äù and provides that the judges of those constitutional courts ‚Äúshall hold their Offices during good Behaviour‚Äù and ‚Äúreceive for their Services[ ] a Compensation[ ] [that] shall not be diminished‚Äù during their tenure. The questions presented in this case are whether a bankruptcy court judge who did not enjoy such tenure and salary protections had the authority under 28 U. S. C. ¬ß157 and Article III to enter final judgment on a counterclaim filed by Vickie Lynn Marshall (whose estate is the petitioner) against Pierce Marshall (whose estate is the respondent) in Vickie‚Äôs bankruptcy proceedings. Vickie married J. Howard Marshall II, Pierce‚Äôs father, approximately a year before his death. Shortly before J. Howard died, Vickie filed a suit against Pierce in Texas state court, asserting that J. Howard meant to provide for Vickie through a trust, and Pierce tortiously interfered with that gift. After J. Howard died, Vickie filed for bankruptcy in federal court. Pierce filed a proof of claim in that proceeding, asserting that he should be able to recover damages from Vickie‚Äôs bankruptcy estate because Vickie had defamed him by inducing her lawyers to tell the press that he had engaged in fraud in controlling his father‚Äôs assets. Vickie responded by filing a counterclaim for tortious interference with the gift she expected from J. Howard. The Bankruptcy Court granted Vickie summary judgment on the defamation claim and eventually awarded her hundreds of millions of dollars in damages on her counterclaim. Pierce objected that the Bankruptcy Court lacked jurisdiction to enter a final judgment on that counterclaim because it was not a ‚Äúcore proceeding‚Äù as defined by 28 U. S. C. ¬ß157(b)(2)(C). As set forth in ¬ß157(a), Congress has divided bankruptcy proceedings into three categories: those that ‚Äúaris[e] under title 11‚Äù; those that ‚Äúaris[e] in‚Äù a Title 11 case; and those that are ‚Äúrelated to a case under title 11.‚Äù District courts may refer all such proceedings to the bankruptcy judges of their district, and bankruptcy courts may enter final judgments in ‚Äúall core proceedings arising under title 11, or arising in a case under title 11.‚Äù ¬ß¬ß157(a), (b)(1). In non-core proceedings, by contrast, a bankruptcy judge may only ‚Äúsubmit proposed findings of fact and conclusions of law to the district court.‚Äù ¬ß157(c)(1). Section 157(b)(2) lists 16 categories of core proceedings, including ‚Äúcounterclaims by the estate against persons filing claims against the estate.‚Äù ¬ß157(b)(2)(C). The Bankruptcy Court concluded that Vickie‚Äôs counterclaim was a core proceeding. The District Court reversed, reading this Court‚Äôs precedent in Northern Pipeline Constr. Co. v. Marathon Pipe Line Co., 458 U. S. 50, to ‚Äúsuggest[ ] that it would be unconstitutional to hold that any and all counterclaims are core.‚Äù The court held that Vickie‚Äôs counterclaim was not core because it was only somewhat related to Pierce‚Äôs claim, and it accordingly treated the Bankruptcy Court‚Äôs judgment as proposed, not final. Although the Texas state court had by that time conducted a jury trial on the merits of the parties‚Äô dispute and entered a judgment in Pierce‚Äôs favor, the District Court went on to decide the matter itself, in Vickie‚Äôs favor. The Court of Appeals ultimately reversed. It held that the Bankruptcy Court lacked authority to enter final judgment on Vickie‚Äôs counterclaim because the claim was not ‚Äúso closely related to [Pierce‚Äôs] proof of claim that the resolution of the counterclaim is necessary to resolve the allowance or disallowance of the claim itself.‚Äù Because that holding made the Texas probate court‚Äôs judgment the earliest final judgment on matters relevant to the case, the Court of Appeals held that the District Court should have given the state judgment preclusive effect.",lexis

"Two abortion clinics and an organization that supported the legal availability of abortion brought, against some groups and individuals who were antiabortion protesters, an action alleging that the protesters had violated a Racketeer Influenced and Corrupt Organizations Act (RICO) provision (18 USCS 1962) by engaging in a nationwide conspiracy to shut down abortion clinics through a pattern of racketeering activity that included acts of extortion in violation of the Hobbs Act (18 USCS 1951), which, in 1951(b)(2), defined extortion as requiring the ""obtaining"" of property from another by wrongful use of actual or threatened force, violence, or fear. The clinics further alleged that (1) the protesters--who had interfered with, and in some instances completely disrupted, the ability of the clinics to function--had conspired to use such actual or threatened force, violence, or fear to induce clinic employees to give up their jobs, physicians to give up their economic right to practice medicine, and patients to give up their right to obtain medical services at the clinics; and (2) this conspiracy had injured the business and property interests of the clinics.",lexis
"After a worker who was employed by a drilling company suffered an injury while working on an oil drilling platform which was located in an area subject to the Longshore and Harbor Workers' Compensation Act (LHWCA) (33 USCS 901 et seq.), the worker (1) filed an administrative claim with the United States Department of Labor against the drilling company and its insurer under the LHWCA; and (2) filed an action in Federal District Court against the platform owner. The drilling company and its insurer paid the worker temporary disability payments for 10 months following the injury. In an informal notice which did not constitute an award, the Department of Labor notified the insurer that the worker was owed permanent disability payments in the total amount of $ 35,592.77, plus penalties and interest. No permanent disability payments were made to the worker by the drilling company or its insurer. Subsequently--and without the written approval of the drilling company and its insurer--the worker settled his action against the platform owner for $ 45,000, of which the worker received $ 29,350.60 after attorneys' fees and expenses. The worker then filed another administrative claim with the Department of Labor against the drilling company and its insurer under the LHWCA. The drilling company and its insurer denied liability on the grounds that under the terms of 33(g)(2) of the LHWCA (33 USCS 933(g)(2))--which specifies that forfeiture occurs if the ""employee"" fails to notify the employer of any settlement with, or judgment against, a third party, regardless of whether the employer or the employer's insurer has made payments or acknowledged entitlement to LHWCA benefits--the worker had forfeited LHWCA benefits by failing to obtain written approval from the drilling company and its insurer of the worker's settlement with the platform owner, which approval was required for a ""person entitled to compensation"" under 33(g)(1) of the LHWCA (33 USCS 933(g)(1)). An administrative law judge (ALJ), finding that the worker was not a ""person entitled to compensation"" under 33(g)(1) because he was not receiving payments at the time of the settlement with the platform owner, ruled in favor of the worker and awarded him (1) $ 35,592.77, less the worker's net recovery from the platform owner of $ 29,350.60; and (2) interest, attorneys' fees, and future medical benefits. On appeal, the Benefits Review Board (BRB) affirmed the decision of the ALJ. On further appeal, the United States Court of Appeals for the Fifth Circuit, reversing the BRB, expressed the view that 33(g) of the LHWCA was unambiguous in providing for forfeiture whenever a claimant under the LHWCA failed to get written approval of a third-party settlement (927 F2d 828).",lexis

The Georgia Court of Appeals reversed, holding that a Georgia statute barring the garnishment of funds or benefits of an employee benefit plan or program subject to ERISA exempted plan benefits from garnishment (178 Ga App 467, 343 SE2d 492).

When South Dakota proposed to tax them, the church and academy took an administrative appeal. The Appeal Referee of the South Dakota Department of Labor--Unemployment Insurance Division ruled that service performed by employees of the church and academy was ""employment"" within the meaning of the statute, but ruled that they were not eligible for exemption because the term ""church,"" as used in the state analogue to 3309(b), referred only to the ""individual 'house of worship' maintained by a particular congregation."" On appeal, the Hughes County Circuit Court reversed, ruling that both the church and the academy were exempt, that the term ""church"" referred to ""an organization of worshippers,"" rather than to a ""house of worship,"" and that the primary purpose of the schools was the propagation of the synod's faith, a religious concern.

"Old-growth forests in the Pacific Northwest are home to the northern spotted owl, which is on the Federal Government's endangered species list. In accordance with environmentalists' position that harvesting timber in these forests would kill the owls, two separate suits--one concerning national forests in Oregon and Washington that were managed by the United States Forest Service, and the other concerning forests in Oregon that were managed by the federal Bureau of Land Management (BLM)--alleging the violation of a combined total of five different federal statutes were filed by environmental groups challenging proposed timber harvesting. In the Forest Service case, the United States District Court for the Western District of Washington preliminarily enjoined certain proposed timber sales; while in the BLM case, the United States District Court for the District of Oregon twice dismissed the action, and the United States Court of Appeals for the Ninth Circuit twice enjoined some of the challenged harvesting pending appeal (884 F2d 1233; 866 F2d 302). In response to this ongoing litigation, Congress enacted 318 of the Department of the Interior and Related Agencies Appropriations Act, 1990 (103 Stat 745), which required some harvesting in the forests managed by the Forest Service and the BLM, but prohibited harvesting altogether in certain areas of the forests. In 318(b)(6)(A), it was stated that ""Congress hereby determines and directs that"" management of the forests according to 318(b)(3) and 318(b)(5) was adequate consideration to meet the statutory requirements that were the basis for the two cases initiated by the environmental groups, which cases were identified in 318(b)(6)(A) by name and caption number. After both District Courts held that 318(b)(6)(A) did not violate the Federal Constitution's Article III by purporting to direct the results in the two pending cases, the United States Court of Appeals for the Ninth Circuit (1) consolidated the ensuing appeals; (2) held that 318(b)(6)(A) was unconstitutional on the ground that, in enacting 318(b)(6)(A), Congress had directed particular decisions in the cases without amending or repealing the statutes underlying the litigation; and (3) reversed the District Court judgments (914 F2d 1311).",lexis

"A former recipient of assistance under Colorado's administration of the Social Security Act's Aid to Families with Dependent Children program (42 USCS 601 et seq.) instituted a class action in the United States District Court for the District of Colorado, challenging the validity of a state regulation fixing a standard allowance of $ 30 per month for certain work expenses, including transportation expenses, to be deducted from income in determining an applicant's eligibility to receive assistance under the program, and limiting the allowance to such amount, even if the applicant could prove actual expenses in excess of $ 30. The plaintiff, who prior to the adoption of such regulation, had qualified for assistance under the program because of her monthly transportation expenses of approximately $ 110, contended that the standardized allowance violated the equal protection clause of the Fourteenth Amendment and 402(a)(7) of the Social Security Act (42 USCS 602(a)(7)), which provides that in determining eligibility for assistance under the program, state agencies must take into consideration ""any expenses reasonably attributable to the earning"" of income.

"Respondent Valencia Gonzales, a death row inmate in Arizona, sought federal habeas relief.

The District Court denied a stay, finding that the claims before it were record based or resolvable as a matter of law and thus would not benefit from Gonzales' input. Gonzales thereafter sought a writ of mandamus in the Ninth Circuit. Applying Rohan and its recent decision in Nash-which gave habeas petitioners a right to competence even on record-based appeals-the court granted the writ, concluding that ¬ß3599 gave Gonzales the right to a stay pending a competency determination. Respondent Sean Carter, a death row inmate in Ohio, initiated federal habeas proceedings but eventually moved for a competency determination and stay of the proceedings. The District Court granted the motion and found Carter incompetent to assist counsel. Applying the Ninth Circuit's Rohan test, it determined that Carter's assistance was required to develop four of his exhausted claims. It thus dismissed his habeas petition without prejudice and prospectively tolled the statute of limitations. On appeal, the Sixth Circuit, relying in part on Rees v. Peyton, 384 U.

The accomplice invoked his privilege against self-incrimination under the Federal Constitution's Fifth Amendment, and the government then offered to introduce into evidence the statements the accomplice made to the police after his arrest, arguing that the statements were admissible as declarations of an unavailable witness against penal interest.

Each employee nonetheless sought to litigate Fair Labor Standards Act and related state law claims through class or collective actions in federal court. Although the Federal Arbitration Act generally requires courts to enforce arbitration agreements as written, the employees argued that its ‚Äúsaving clause‚Äù removes this obligation if an arbitration agreement violates some other federal law and that, by requiring individualized proceedings, the agreements here violated the National Labor Relations Act. The employers countered that the Arbitration Act protects agreements requiring arbitration from judicial interference and that neither the saving clause nor the NLRA demands a different conclusion. Until recently, courts as well as the National Labor Relations Board's general counsel agreed that such arbitration agreements are enforceable. In 2012, however, the Board ruled that the NLRA effectively nullifies the Arbitration Act in cases like these, and since then other courts have either agreed with or deferred to the Board's position.",lexis
"On the same day that the United States District Court for the District of Nevada unsealed an indictment against a property owner for distributing marijuana, laundering money, and related crimes, the District Court unsealed a civil complaint, that had been brought under 21 USCS 881(a)(6) and 881(a)(7) against the owner by the United States, seeking forfeiture of the owner's properties that were located in the United States and allegedly had been purchased with proceeds of the owner's illegal drug sales or had been used to facilitate the sales. The owner, who was a citizen of the United States and Switzerland, and who had moved to Switzerland with his family before the indictment and the forfeiture complaint were unsealed, did not return to face the criminal charges and could not be extradited. While remaining outside the United States, the owner filed an answer contesting the forfeiture. The District Court--expressing the view that the owner was not entitled to be heard in the civil forfeiture action because he remained outside the country, unamenable to criminal prosecution--granted the government's motion to strike the owner's claims and entered summary judgment against the owner (755 F Supp 308). Subsequently, after dealing with procedural matters largely involving attempts by the owner's wife to contest the forfeiture, the District Court entered a final order vesting title to the properties in the United States. The United States Court of Appeals for the Ninth Circuit, in affirming, expressed the view that the District Court had properly dismissed, under the fugitive disentitlement doctrine, the owner's claims to the properties (47 F3d 1511).",lexis

With respect to the prisoner's Fourteenth Amendment due process claim that his conviction rested on insufficient evidence, the District Court denied habeas corpus relief on the ground that under the ""no evidence"" test the case was not devoid of an evidentiary basis for the prisoner's conviction.

"An employer that maintained, was the sole source of funding for, and was the administrator and fiduciary of its employees' termination pay plan, retirement plan, and stock purchase plan, all of which were governed by the Employee Retirement Income Security Act of 1974, as amended (ERISA) (29 USCS 1001 et seq.), sold one of its divisions. Salaried nonunion divisional employees who were rehired by the division purchaser sought (1) severance benefits under the termination pay plan, which provided for termination pay in the event of a workforce reduction, and (2) information about their benefits under all three plans pursuant to 29 USCS 1024(b)(4). The employer denied the request for severance benefits on the ground that the sale of the division did not constitute a workforce reduction, within the meaning of the termination pay plan, and denied the requests for information on the ground that the employees were no longer plan ""participants"" entitled to the information. Subsequently, the employees brought an action seeking to recover severance benefits under 29 USCS 1132(a)(1)(B), and to recover damages, under 29 USCS 1132(c)(1)(B), for the employer's failure to disclose the requested information. The United States District Court for the Eastern District of Pennsylvania, granting the employer's summary judgment motion, held that (1) the employer had satisfied its fiduciary duty under ERISA, because its decision not to pay the severance benefits was not arbitrary or capricious, and (2) the employer had no duty to provide the requested information to the employees, because they were not plan ""participants"" or ""beneficiaries"" when they requested the information (640 F Supp 519). On appeal, the United States Court of Appeals for the Third Circuit, reversing the granting of summary judgment on both counts, and remanding the case to the District Court, held that (1) where an employer is the fiduciary and administrator of its employees' unfunded benefit plan, its decision to deny plan benefits should be subject to de novo judicial review, rather than to the arbitrary and capricious standard of review, and (2) the right to receive information about an employee benefit plan extends both to people entitled to a benefit under the plan and to people who claim to be, but are not, entitled to a plan benefit (828 F2d 134).",lexis

Citing Bowles, the Veterans Court dismissed the veteran's appeal. In reversing the appellate court's affirmance, the U.S. Supreme Court held that the reasoning of Bowles did not apply to review of a denial of veterans' benefits, which was similar to judicial review of an administrative denial of Social Security disability benefits, particularly as the case involved review by a U.S. Const. art.

In holding that the ¬¨√ü 7266(a) deadline was not jurisdictional, the Court noted that the plain language of the statute and its placement within the statutory framework, as well as Congressional solicitude for veterans, indicated the 120 day limit of ¬¨√ü 7266(a) was not intended to be jurisdictional.",lexis

"With respect to a motor common carrier, the Interstate Commerce Act (ICA) (1) requires, under 49 USCS 10701, the adoption of reasonable rates and practices; (2) requires, under 49 USCS 10741, that such rates not be discriminatory; (3) requires, under 49 USCS 10762(a)(1), that a carrier publish and file with the Interstate Commerce Commission (ICC) tariffs containing the rates for the transportation the carrier may provide; and (4) prohibits, in 49 USCS 10761(a), a carrier from providing services at any rate other than the filed rate, also known as the tariff rate. The requirement to adhere to the filed rate has become known as the filed rate doctrine. Beginning in 1986, however, the ICC--citing changes in the motor carrier industry--adopted a negotiated rates policy according to which a shipper, under certain circumstances, was relieved of the obligation of paying the filed rate when the shipper and a motor common carrier had privately negotiated a lower rate. From 1981 to 1983, a motor common carrier which was a subsidiary of a parent company (1) privately negotiated rates with a shipper that were lower than the carrier's rates on file with the ICC, and (2) never filed the negotiated rates with the ICC. In 1983, the carrier's parent company filed for bankruptcy. After the shipper had refused to pay agents of the bankrupt estate for the alleged undercharges resulting from the prior billing of the shipper at the negotiated rather than the filed rate, the estate brought suit in the United States District Court for the Western District of Missouri against the shipper for the difference between the filed rates and the negotiated rates. The District Court, finding certain matters to be within the primary jurisdiction of the ICC, stayed the proceedings and referred the case to the ICC, which, ruling in favor of the shipper under the negotiated rates policy, expressed the view that (1) 10701 authorized the ICC to consider all the circumstances surrounding an undercharge suit to determine whether collection of the filed rate would constitute an unreasonable practice; and (2) the carrier was not entitled to recover the filed rates in the case at hand, where (a) the carrier and the shipper had negotiated rates other than the tariff rates, (b) the shipper had relied on the carrier to file the rates with the ICC, (c) the shipper had reasonably believed that the amounts quoted and billed by the carrier were the correct total charges for the transportation services performed, and (d) the shipper had made full payment. The case then returned to the District Court, which granted summary judgment for the shipper and expressed the view that (1) the ICC's policy was based on a permissible construction of the ICA, and (2) the ICC's finding that the carrier had engaged in an unreasonable practice was supported by substantial evidence (705 F Supp 1401). On appeal, the United States Court of Appeals for the Eighth Circuit, in affirming, expressed the view that the ICC's approach (1) was consistent with the ICA, and (2) did not abolish the filed rate doctrine, but (3) merely allowed the ICC to consider all the circumstances, including equitable defenses, to determine if strict adherence to the filed rate doctrine would constitute an unreasonable practice (879 F2d 400).",lexis
"Deficiencies in a taxpayer's income taxes were assessed by the Commissioner of Internal Revenue within the period specified in waivers of the statute of limitations which were executed by the taxpayer more than 3 years but less than 5 years after the taxpayer's returns for the years in question were filed. Although 275(a) of the Internal Revenue Code of 1939 limits the assessment of tax deficiencies to 3 years from the date on which the taxpayer filed his return, the Commissioner, in proceedings in the Tax Court in which it was sought to collect the deficiencies, contended that the taxpayer was within the special 5-year period of limitations which, under 275(c) of the Code, applies when a taxpayer ""omits from gross income an amount properly includible therein"" which is in excess of 25 per cent of the amount of gross income stated in the return. The Commissioner argued that there was such an omission from gross income by the taxpayer, who had understated his gross income as a consequence of miscalculating profits from the sale of realty by erroneously including an excessive item of cost.

"An investor, who was a veteran of two unsuccessful oil and gas investment ventures, invested approximately $ 310,000 with an oil and gas producer in a drilling venture involving leaseholds acquired by and held in the name of the producer. The investor then contacted a number of friends, family members, and business associates about the venture, all of whom, because of the investor's involvement, decided to invest about $ 7,500 in the venture, although most of them had not met or spoken to the producer or personally toured the leaseholds. The investor helped each of his contacts complete a subscription-agreement form which the producer had prepared. Each form stated that the venture interests were being sold without benefit of registration under the Securities Act of 1933 (15 USCS 77a et seq.), in reliance on a Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) rule then in effect, and the interests were never registered with the SEC. The contacts' investment checks were made payable to the producer's company, and the investor received no commission in connection with the purchases. When the drilling venture failed and the investment interests proved to be worthless, the investor and the contacts brought suit against the producer in the United States District Court for the Northern District of Texas, seeking rescission of their investment agreements on grounds that such agreements constituted the unlawful sale of unregistered securities under 12(1) of the Securities Act of 1933 (15 USCS 77l(1)). The producer, in response, (1) asserted that the investor's claim was barred by the equitable defense of in pari delicto, and (2) moved to realign the investor as a third-party defendant, on grounds that the investor was a ""seller"" of the venture interests to the contacts within the meaning of 12(1). The District Court denied the producer's motion to realign and, after a bench trial, granted judgment for the investor and the contacts on their 12(1) rescission claims, making no specific mention of the producer's in pari delicto defense against the investor. On appeal, the United States Court of Appeals for the Fifth Circuit affirmed, holding that (1) the in pari delicto defense was not available in an action under 12(1), since that section created a strict liability offense rather than liability based on intentional misconduct, and (2) the investor was not a ""seller"" under 12(1), since there was no evidence that the investor sought or received any financial benefit in return for his advice to the contacts (787 F2d 985).

"An Indiana state reformatory inmate filed a complaint under 42 USCS 1983 in the United States District Court for the Southern District of Indiana, alleging that (1) a reformatory doctor, the administrator of the reformatory infirmary, and other correctional officials had violated the inmate's rights under the Federal Constitution's Eighth Amendment by refusing to treat a small brain tumor that affected his equilibrium, and (2) correctional officials had violated the due process clause of the Fourteenth Amendment by transferring him to a less desirable cellhouse without a hearing. Along with the complaint, the inmate filed a motion to proceed in forma pauperis pursuant to 28 USCS 1915(a). The District Court, invoking 28 USCS 1915(d)--which authorizes a federal court, in a proceeding in forma pauperis, to dismiss the case if the court is satisfied that the action is frivolous--dismissed the complaint sua sponte as frivolous on the grounds that the inmate had failed to state a claim upon which relief could be granted for the purpose of Rule 12(b)(6) of the Federal Rules of Civil Procedure. The District Court said that the pleadings did not state a claim under (1) the Eighth Amendment, because there was no allegation of deliberate indifference to serious medical needs, or (2) the due process clause, because a prisoner has no constitutionally protected interest in being incarcerated in a particular institution or wing. Subsequently the District Court denied the inmate's motion to vacate the judgment and amend his pleadings. The United States Court of Appeals for the Seventh Circuit, affirming in part and reversing in part, held that (1) the District Court had wrongly equated the standard for frivolousness of a complaint under 1915(d) with the standard for failure to state a claim under Rule 12(b)(6), and (2) the Eighth Amendment claims against the infirmary doctor and administrator had been wrongly dismissed, because it was not certain that the inmate was unable to make any rational argument in law or fact to support those claims. Accordingly, the Court of Appeals remanded those claims to the District Court.

A RICO claim based on predicate acts of mail fraud only required use of the mails as a significant part of the alleged pattern of misrepresentations, and reliance by the county was sufficient to support the RICO claim.

The defendant bank claimed that it could not be sued in Nebraska because of 12 USC 94, providing that suits against a national bank may be had in any state or county court in the county in which the bank is located having jurisdiction in similar cases. This contention was rejected by the state courts and judgment was rendered for the plaintiffs. Upon the bank's appeal the Supreme Court of Nebraska affirmed.

"Following jury verdicts finding the defendant guilty of making a false statement to a federal agency (18 USCS 1001) and willfully failing to report that he was carrying more than $ 5,000 into the United States (31 USCS 1058, 1101) (recodified at 31 USCS 5322(a), 5316), the trial court sentenced him to a prison term on the false statement count, a felony, and a consecutive term of probation on the currency reporting count, a misdemeanor. Both convictions were based on the defendant's having falsely answered ""no"" to a question on a Customs form asking whether he was carrying more than $ 5,000 upon his arrival into the country. The United States Court of Appeals for the Ninth Circuit reversed the conviction for making a false statement (726 F2d 1320), concluding that the false statement felony was a lesser included offense of the currency reporting misdemeanor and that Congress presumably intended someone in the defendant's position to be punished only for the currency reporting misdemeanor.",lexis

"A motorist was stopped by a police officer on suspicion of driving while intoxicated, performed poorly on a series of sobriety tests, and stated to the officer that he had failed the tests because he had been drinking, whereupon the officer arrested the motorist and took him to a booking center. Officers at the booking center, following the usual practice with drunk-driving suspects, videotaped the booking proceedings, during which the motorist, who was informed of the videotaping, (1) responded to questions as to his name, address, height, weight, eye color, date of birth, and current age, stumbling over his address and age; (2) responded to a question whether he knew the date of his sixth birthday, first with an inaudible reply and subsequently by saying, ""No, I don't""; (3) repeated the sobriety tests, in which he again performed poorly, and during which he (a) failed to complete requested verbal counts, (b) attempted to explain his difficulties in performing the tests, and (c) often requested clarification of his instructions; and (4) refused to take a breathalyzer test, after asking a number of questions about the law and commenting in the process on his state of inebriation. The motorist was then advised of his Miranda rights for the first time, signed a statement waiving those rights, and admitted under questioning that he had been driving while intoxicated. Both the video and audio portions of the videotape were admitted into evidence at the motorist's bench trial before the Court of Common Pleas of Cumberland County, Pennsylvania, which trial resulted in the motorist's conviction for driving under the influence of alcohol. The motorist moved for a new trial, partly on the ground that the videotape should have been suppressed because it was incriminating and had been completed before the motorist received a Miranda warning. The Court of Common Pleas denied the motion, but the Superior Court of Pennsylvania reversed, as it held that the admission of the videotape had violated the motorist's privilege against self-incrimination under the Federal Constitution's Fifth Amendment, and that the audio portion of the tape should have been suppressed in its entirety (377 Pa Super 382, 547 A2d 419).

"After a union levied fines on several of its members for strikebreaking, and filed state court suits against nine individual employees to collect the fines, the employer filed a charge against the union, and a complaint was issued alleging that the attempted court enforcement of the fines violated 8(b)(1)(A) of the amended National Labor Relations Act. The NLRB ruled that (1) the union violated 8(b)(1)(A) by imposing disciplinary fines on employees for acts committed after the employees had resigned from the union, (2) the union did not violate 8(b)(1)(A) by fining employees for acts committed before they resigned from the union, and (3) the validly- levied fines would not be examined to determine whether they were impermissibly excessive (185 NLRB No. 23).

"Respondent Valencia Gonzales, a death row inmate in Arizona, sought federal habeas relief. His counsel moved to stay the proceedings, contending that Gonzales' mental incompetence prevented him from rationally communicating with or assisting counsel, and that Gonzales was thus entitled to a stay because, under the Ninth Circuit's Rohan decision, what is now 18 U. S. C. ¬ß3599(a)(2) requires a stay when a petitioner is adjudged incompetent. The District Court denied a stay, finding that the claims before it were record based or resolvable as a matter of law and thus would not benefit from Gonzales' input. Gonzales thereafter sought a writ of mandamus in the Ninth Circuit. Applying Rohan and its recent decision in Nash-which gave habeas petitioners a right to competence even on record-based appeals-the court granted the writ, concluding that ¬ß3599 gave Gonzales the right to a stay pending a competency determination. Respondent Sean Carter, a death row inmate in Ohio, initiated federal habeas proceedings but eventually moved for a competency determination and stay of the proceedings. The District Court granted the motion and found Carter incompetent to assist counsel. Applying the Ninth Circuit's Rohan test, it determined that Carter's assistance was required to develop four of his exhausted claims. It thus dismissed his habeas petition without prejudice and prospectively tolled the statute of limitations. On appeal, the Sixth Circuit, relying in part on Rees v. Peyton, 384 U.

The U.S. Supreme Court unanimously held that the attorneys were debt relief agencies.

Further, the attorneys were not precluded under 11 U.S.C.S. ¬¨√ü 526(a)(4) from advising clients to incur more debt for valid purposes, and were only precluded from providing such advice when contemplation of bankruptcy was the impelling reason for the advice.

The defendants moved to dismiss under 12 USCS 1821(k), which (1) provided that a director or officer of a federally insured depository institution could be held personally liable for monetary damages for ""gross negligence"" or conduct demonstrating a greater disregard of a duty of care than gross negligence; and (2) contained a savings clause to the effect that nothing in 1821(k) would impair or affect any right of the RTC under ""other applicable law."" The District Court, in dismissing all but the gross negligence claims, expressed the view that 1821(k), by authorizing actions for gross negligence or more seriously culpable conduct, intended to forbid actions based upon less seriously culpable conduct, such as simple negligence. The United States Court of Appeals for the Third Circuit, in reversing in pertinent part on interlocutory appeal, concluded that the receiver could pursue any claims for negligence or breach of fiduciary duty available as a matter of federal common law, as (1) 1821(k) simply offered a safeguard against state legislation that had watered down applicable state standards of care below a gross negligence benchmark; (2) 1821(k), as so interpreted, did not prohibit actions resting upon stricter standard of care rules originating in state law or federal common law; and (3) federal common law was applicable to federally chartered depository institutions such as the savings association in question (57 F.3d 1231).",lexis

A trial was held in 1976 in which the District Court found that (1) in 1954, when the United States Supreme Court had ruled that the equal protection clause of the Fourteenth Amendment prohibits states from maintaining racially segregated schools, the Board had not been operating a racially neutral, unitary school system, but had been operating separate, black schools in one area of the city, such racial separation being the direct result of cognitive acts or omissions of the school board administrators and members who had originally intentionally caused and later perpetuated the racial isolation, (2) the Board had been under a continuous constitutional obligation to disestablish the dual school system in existence in 1954 and had failed to discharge its duty, and (3) in the intervening years since 1954 the Board's actions and practices could not reasonably be explained without reference to racial concerns that intentionally aggravated, rather than alleviated, racial separation in the schools, such matters including the practice of assigning black teachers only to those schools with substantial black student populations, the use of optional attendance zones, discontiguous attendance zones and boundary changes, and the selection of sites for new school construction that had the foreseeable and anticipated effect of maintaining the racial separation of schools. The District Court concluded that at the time of trial, segregation of the races in the Columbus school system had directly resulted from the Board's intentional segregative acts and omissions in violation of equal protection under the Fourteenth Amendment.

The probation officer's presentence report (1) confirmed this expectation, (2) found the applicable sentencing range to be 30 to 37 months' imprisonment, and (3) concluded that there were no factors that would warrant departure from the guideline sentence. The United States District Court for the District of Columbia, however, announced at the conclusion of the sentencing hearing that the court would depart from the Guidelines' sentencing range and sentence the employee to 60 months' imprisonment, based on (1) the extensive duration of the employee's criminal conduct, (2) the disruption to governmental functions caused by the employee's criminal conduct, and (3) the employee's use of tax evasion to conceal his other offenses. On appeal, the employee argued that Rule 32 of the Federal Rules of Criminal Procedure--which provides in part that counsel for each side must be provided an opportunity, at the sentencing hearing, to comment on the probation officer's determination and on ""other matters relating to the appropriate sentence""--required the District Court to furnish advance notice of its intent to depart from the Guidelines.

Later health premium payments were supposed to be effected through payroll deductions and the city clerk's issuance of checks to the individual, but the individual allegedly misappropriated most of the payments.

Several city employees eventually (1) filed suit in the Circuit Court for Jefferson County, Alabama against the first company and the individual, but not against the second company; (2) alleged that the individual had collected premiums but failed to remit them, so that the employees' health insurance policies had supposedly lapsed without their knowledge; and (3) claimed damages for fraud.

"Five years after the Food and Drug Administration (FDA) first approved metoclopramide, a drug commonly used to treat digestive tract problems, under the brand name Reglan, generic manufacturers such as petitioners also began producing the drug. Because of accumulating evidence that long-term metoclopramide use can cause tardive dyskinesia, a severe neurological disorder, warning labels for the drug have been strengthened and clarified several times, most recently in 2009. Respondents were prescribed Reglan in 2001 and 2002, but both received the generic drug from their pharmacists. After taking the drug as prescribed for several years, both developed tardive dyskinesia. In separate state-court tort actions, they sued petitioners, the generic drug manufacturers that produced the metoclopramide they took (Manufacturers). Each respondent alleged, inter alia, that longterm metoclopramide use caused her disorder and that the Manufacturers were liable under state tort law for failing to provide adequate warning labels. In both suits, the Manufacturers urged that federal statutes and FDA regulations pre-empted the state tort claims by requiring the same safety and efficacy labeling for generic metoclopramide as was mandated at the time for Reglan. The Fifth and Eighth Circuits rejected these arguments, holding that respondents‚Äô claims were not pre-empted.",lexis
"If one of the federal agencies covered by the Freedom of Information Act (FOIA) (5 USCS 552) denies a request for information, the FOIA, in 552(a)(4)(B), confers jurisdiction on the Federal District Courts ""to order the production of any agency records improperly withheld."" The Tax Division of the United States Department of Justice, as the representative of the Federal Government in nearly all civil tax cases in the Federal District Courts, receives copies of all opinions and orders issued by those courts in such cases. The Division sends the originals to official Department files and makes copies for Division use. An organization published (1) a weekly magazine including summaries of recent federal court decisions on tax issues, and (2) a daily electronic data base including summaries and full texts of recent federal court tax decisions. After the organization, in 1979, first filed with the Department a FOIA request for the Division's copies of District Court tax opinions, a compromise was arranged, whereby the request was withdrawn, while the organization obtained access to the Division's weekly log of tax cases. The organization then directly requested copies of the decisions noted on the log from the respective District Court clerks and from participating attorneys. However, the organization, frustrated by alleged delays and gaps in the process, initiated, in 1984-1985, a new, approximately weekly series of FOIA requests, in each of which the organization asked the Department to provide to make available copies of all District Court tax opinions and final orders identified in the Division's weekly logs. The Department denied the requests, and the organization's administrative appeal was unsuccessful. The organization then filed suit in the United States District Court for the District of Columbia and sought, under the FOIA, to compel the Department to provide the organization with access to such decisions, but the District Court granted the Department's motion to dismiss the complaint, on the ground that the decisions had not been ""improperly withheld,"" under 552(a)(4)(B), because the decisions were already available on the public record from their primary sources, the District Courts (643 F Supp 740). On appeal, the United States Court of Appeals for the District of Columbia Circuit, reversing, expressed the view that (1) the District Court decisions had been ""improperly withheld,"" even though the decisions were available elsewhere; (2) the decisions were ""agency records,"" even though the decisions had originated in a part of the Federal Government not covered by the FOIA; and (3) on remand, the District Court was to enter an order directing the Department to provide some reasonable form of access to the decisions (269 App DC 315, 845 F2d 1060).",lexis

"As a condition of obtaining access to classified information, federal employees in the Executive Branch are required to sign ""nondisclosure agreements"" that (1) detail the employees' obligation of confidentiality, and (2) provide for penalities in the event of unauthorized disclosure. Two such forms--Standard Form 189, devised by the Director of the Information Security Oversight Office, and Form 4193, devised by the Director of Central Intelligence--forbade employees to reveal classified or ""classifiable"" information to persons unauthorized to receive such information. Section 630 of the Continuing Resolution for Fiscal Year 1988 (PL 100-202, 101 Stat 1329-432, continued with identical restrictions for fiscal year 1989 in 619 of PL 100-440, 102 Stat 1756), prohibited the expenditure of funds in fiscal year 1988 for the implementation or enforcement of Form 189, Form 4193, or any other form that violated several specified restrictions. Although the Directors took some actions in response to 630, a foreign service association and several members of Congress filed suit in the United States District Court for the District of Columbia against the two Directors and challenged the Directors' use of Forms 189 and 4193, on the ground that the use violated 630. The lawsuit was consolidated with two other cases, which were brought by federal employee organizations, and which included claims that the forms (1) violated 630, and (2) were so vague and overbroad as to inhibit employees' speech in violation of the Federal Constitution's First Amendment. The District Court (1) assumed that the Executive's actions since the enactment of 630 did not comply with the requirements of 630, on the ground that the actions were not true to the congressional mandates from which the actions derived authority and were likely to be found to be contrary to law upon judicial review; but (2) concluded that 630 unconstitutionally restricted the President's power to fulfill the obligations imposed upon him by his constitutional authority as to national security and his role as to foreign relations; and (3) entered summary judgment in favor of the Directors (688 F Supp 671).",lexis

Two remittances--a withholding of 4,104 from a calendar year taxpayer's wages throughout 1988 by the taxpayer's employer, and an estimated income tax of 1,100 remitted on January 15, 1999 by the taxpayer--were made to the Internal Revenue Service (IRS) toward the taxpayer's 1988 federal income tax liability. After receiving a filing extension from April 15, 1989 until August 15, 1989, the taxpayer failed to file his 1988 federal income tax return until June 1, 1993. On the return, he claimed a 1,175 overpayment and asked the IRS to apply this amount as a credit toward his 1989 taxable year. The IRS denied the requested credit on the basis that the ceiling imposed by 6511(b)(2)(A) for a refund or credit of the taxpayer's income tax payments for 1988 was zero, because the relevant look-back period supposedly extended 3 years and 4 months from June 1, 1993 to February 1, 1990, during which period, according to the IRS, the taxpayer had paid none of overpaid taxes. The taxpayer commenced a refund suit in a Federal District Court.

"Under 5 USCS 8337(a), disabled federal employees who have completed 5 years of service are eligible for a disability annuity. Section 8337(d) provides that entitlement to disability annuity payments will end if the retired employee is restored to an earning capacity fairly comparable to the current rate of pay of the position occupied at the time of retirement. Prior to 1982, 8337(d) provided that an individual was deemed restored to earning capacity if, in each of 2 succeeding calendar years, his or her income from wages or self-employment equaled at least 80 percent of the current rate of pay of the position occupied at the time of retirement. In 1982, the statute was amended to provide that earning capacity is deemed restored if the 80-percent figure is equaled in any single calendar year. An employee at a Navy Public Works Center retired in 1981 and was deemed eligible for a disability annuity by the Office of Personnel Management (OPM). The employee subsequently undertook part-time work and from 1982 to 1985 earned an average of $ 12,494, leaving him under the 80-percent limit for entitlement to annuity payments. In 1986, he had an opportunity to earn more money by working overtime. To find out how much he could earn without exceeding the 80-percent limit, he consulted the personnel department at his former place of employment and was erroneously informed by an employee relations specialist that his eligibility for continued payments would be determined under the pre-1982 2-year rule. The specialist also gave the employee a copy of an OPM publication which stated the 2-year rule but which was out of date and therefore inaccurate. After receiving the erroneous information, the employee concluded that he could accept overtime in 1986 without losing disability benefits as long as his income for the preceding and following years was below the 80-percent limit. His 1986 income was above the 80-percent limit, and the OPM discontinued his disability annuity on June 30, 1987. The annuity was restored on January 1, 1988, because the employee did not earn more than the 80-percent limit in 1987. The employee appealed the 6-month denial of benefits to the Merit Systems Protection Board (MSPB), arguing that the erroneous advice given to him by Navy personnel should have estopped the OPM from discontinuing his payments. In denying the employee's petition for review, the MSPB noted that the erroneous advice had been given by officials of the Navy, not of the OPM, and stated that the OPM could not be estopped from enforcing a statutory requirement for eligibility. On appeal, the United States Court of Appeals for the Fourth Circuit reversed (862 F2d 294), as it accepted the employee's contention that the misinformation from Navy personnel estopped the government and that the estoppel required payment of the annuity notwithstanding the statutory provision to the contrary.",lexis

In the first case (No. 81-2386), the United States District Court for the District of Maryland granted summary judgment for the employer and the union, holding that the state 30-day statute of limitations for actions to vacate arbitration awards applied both to the claim against the employer and the claim against the union (524 F Supp 721). The United States Court of Appeals for the Fourth Circuit affirmed on the basis of the District Court's order (679 F2d 879). In the second case (No. 81-2408), the United States District Court for the Western District of New York dismissed the complaint against both defendants, holding that the entire suit was governed by New York's 90-day statute of limitation for actions to vacate arbitration awards.

After the call, the officer and his partner proceeded to the apartment complex.

After one of the officers requested a patrol unit to stop the vehicle, the vehicle was stopped, just short of the motel.

The District Court granted the writ on the ground that Negroes had been impermissibly excluded from the grand jury, but the United States Court of Appeals for the Fifth Circuit reversed, holding that the Louisiana waiver provision had to be given effect unless there was a showing of actual prejudice (496 F2d 896).",lexis

"As a consequence of allowing for some lateral movement by the drawbar in a railroad car's coupler, in order to prevent moving cars from derailing on a curved track, the drawbar may remain off-center when cars are uncoupled. Thus, railroad employees must realign drawbars manually to insure the proper automatic coupling of cars by clamps known as knuckles, which are joined to the ends of the drawbars. After a railroad employee injured his back while attempting to realign a drawbar, the employee (1) filed an action in an Illinois state trial court against the railroad, and (2) alleged that the railroad had violated 2 of the Safety Appliance Act (SAA) (49 USCS 20302(a)(1)(A)), which was enacted in 1893, and which, as amended, required that railroad vehicles be equipped with couplers coupling automatically by impact, and capable of being uncoupled, without the necessity of individuals going between the ends of the vehicles. The trial court granted the employee's motion for a directed verdict on the issue of liability. On appeal, an Illinois appellate court, affirming, adhered to its authority which permitted railroad employees to recover under 2 for injuries sustained while attempting to align a misaligned drawbar (268 Ill App 3d 561, 644 NE2d 508). The Illinois Supreme Court denied review (161 Ill 2d 526, 649 NE2d 416).",lexis
"An employer set up an employee benefit plan subject to the provisions of the Employee Retirement Income Security Act (ERISA) (29 USCS 1001 et seq.) for its salaried employees. A salaried employee was involved in a job-related accident, sustained a back injury, and filed a worker's compensation claim. Subsequent to returning to his job, the employee took a leave of absence from work due to severe emotional problems, and the insurer which underwrote the employee benefit plan began paying disability benefits to the employee under the plan. At the insurer's request, the employee submitted to an examination by a psychiatrist. The psychiatrist determined that the employee was emotionally unable to work. After a followup examination a few weeks later, however, the psychiatrist determined that the employee was fit for work, and the insurer terminated the employee's benefit payments. The employee filed a supplemental claim for benefits alleging that his work-related back injury disabled him from working. At the insurer's request, the employee was examined by an orthopedist. No orthopedic problems were found, and the insurer denied the supplemental disability claim. Upon submitting to a physician's examination at the employer's medical department, the employee was found to be not disabled. The employee refused to return to work, and his employment was terminated. The employee filed suit against the employer and the insurer in a Michigan state court, the Wayne County Circuit Court, alleging various state law causes of action, including a claim for disability benefits. The employer and the insurer removed the suit to the United States District Court for the Eastern District of Michigan alleging federal question jurisdiction over the disability benefits claim by virtue of ERISA and pendent jurisdiction over the remaining claims. The District Court found the case properly removable and granted the employer and the insurer summary judgment on the merits (588 F Supp 562). The United States Court of Appeals for the Sixth Circuit reversed on the ground that the District Court lacked removal jurisdiction. The Court of Appeals (1) found that the employee's complaint stated only state law causes of action subject to the federal defense of ERISA pre-emption and that the ""well-pleaded complaint"" rule precluded removal on the basis of a federal defense, and (2) held that the doctrine permitting the removal of cases purporting to state only state-law claims in labor cases pre-empted by 301 of the Labor Management Relations Act (29 USCS 185) did not apply to this case (763 F2d 216).",lexis
"A Delaware corporation with executive headquarters in Texas publicly announced its intent to make a tender offer to purchase shares of stock of a Washington corporation whose principal business, executive offices, and major assets were located in Idaho. The Texas-based corporation seeking the acquisition filed a schedule with the Securities and Exchange Commission as required by 13 of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended by the Williams Act (15 USCS 78m), and filed documents with the Idaho Commission of Finance in an attempt to satisfy Idaho's takeover statute. After Idaho officials requested additional information and entered an order delaying the effective date of the tender offer, the Texas-based corporation filed an action in the United States District Court for the Northern District of Texas against the Idaho officials, praying for a declaration that the Idaho statute was invalid insofar as it purported to apply to interstate cash tender offers to purchase securities traded on a national exchange. The Idaho officials appeared specially to contest jurisdiction, venue, and the merits of the claim, but the District Court found four grounds for federal subject matter jurisdiction, held that personal jurisdiction over the Idaho defendants had been obtained pursuant to the Texas longarm statute, that venue, although improper under the general venue statute (28 USCS 1391(b)), could be sustained under the special venue provision of 27 of the Securities Exchange Act (15 USCS 78aa), and that the takeover statute was preempted by the Williams Act and placed an impermissible burden on interstate commerce (439 F Supp 420). On appeal, United States Court of Appeals for the Fifth Circuit affirmed, holding, among other things, that venue was authorized by the terms of 27 of the Securities Exchange Act--providing that jurisdiction and venue may be had for actions brought to enforce ""any liability or duty"" created by the Act--because Idaho's enforcement attempt, by conflicting with the Williams Act, constituted a violation of a ""duty"" imposed by 28(a) of the Securities Exchange Act (15 USCS 78bb(a)), which provides that the jurisdiction of a state securities commission is not affected by the Act insofar as it does not conflict with the Act, and that venue was also proper under 28 USCS 1391(b), providing that when jurisdiction is not founded solely on diversity of citizenship, civil actions may be brought in the judicial district where all defendants reside, ""or in which the claim arose,"" because the alleged invalid restraint against the Texas-based corporation had occurred in the Northern District of Texas (577 F2d 1256).",lexis

The District Court certified the class, and the Ninth Circuit affirmed. The Ninth Circuit rejected Amgen's argument that Connecticut Retirement was required to prove the materiality of Amgen's alleged misrepresentations and omissions before class certification in order to satisfy Rule 23(b)(3)'s requirement that ""questions of law or fact common to class members predominate over any questions affecting only individual members.""

"Nevada state game wardens, suspecting that a member of the Fallon Paiute-Shoshone Indian tribes had violated state law by killing protected game animals outside the tribes' reservation in Nevada, obtained search warrants from both state and tribal courts and, pursuant thereto, unsuccessfully searched the member's home on tribal land for the heads of the animals in question. The member brought an action in tribal court, which action ultimately asserted that the wardens in their individual capacities were liable to the member under tribal and federal law for trespass, abuse of process, and violation of the member's civil rights, the latter allegedly being remediable under 42 USCS 1983.

"California's mobile home residency law (MRL) (1) limited the bases on which a mobile home park owner could terminate a mobile home owner's rental of space in the park; (2) generally prohibited park owners from requiring the removal of a mobile home when it was sold; (3) prohibited park owners from charging transfer fees for such sales; and (4) prohibited park owners from disapproving of a purchaser who was able to pay the rent. Following enactment of the MRL, a California city enacted a mobile home rent control ordinance which set back existing rents to the level of 2 years earlier and required park owners to obtain the approval of the city council for any rent increases. The owners of two mobile home parks in the city filed suit against the city in the Superior Court of San Diego County, California, which suit(1) contended that the combined effect of the rent control ordinance and the MRL amounted to a ""taking"" of property by permanent physical occupation, for which just compensation was required under the Federal Constitution's Fifth Amendment, because the state law generally required park owners to accept the purchaser of a mobile home as a new tenant, and, as a result, existing tenants had been able to monetize the value of living in a rent-controlled jurisdiction by raising the price of used mobile homes, transferring to the tenants a discrete interest in land--the right to occupy the land indefinitely at sub-market rent--which amounted to a right of physical occupation; and (2) sought damages and declaratory and injunctive relief.

"Both state-court and federal-court litigation occurred after (1) the results of the 2000 census reduced Mississippi's seats in the United States House of Representatives from five to four, and (2) the state legislature failed to pass a congressional redistricting plan. Article I, 4 of the Federal Constitution (1) provided that the times, places, and manner of holding congressional elections would be prescribed in each state ""by the Legislature thereof""; but (2) reserved to Congress the power to make or alter such regulations, except as to the places of choosing Senators. With respect to the House of Representatives, 2 USCS 2a(c), which had originally been enacted in 1941, provided that until a state was ""redistricted in the manner provided by the law thereof after any apportionment,"" then pursuant to 2 USCS 2a(c)(5), the Representatives to which the state was entitled under such apportionment would be elected from the state at large, if there was a decrease in the number of Representatives and the number of districts in such state exceeded such decreased number of Representatives. Also, a Mississippi statute provided in pertinent part that if an election of Representatives occurred after the number of Representatives to which the state was entitled had been diminished in consequence of a new apportionment--and before the state's districts had been changed to conform to the new apportionment--then the Representatives would be elected at large. However, 2 USCS 2c, which had originally been enacted in 1967, provided that in each state entitled to more than one Representative under an apportionment, there would be established ""by law"" a number of districts equal to the number of Representatives to which the state was entitled, and Representatives would be elected only from districts so established, no district to elect more than one Representative. In addition, 5 of the Voting Rights Act of 1965 (42 USCS 1973c) generally required that whenever a covered jurisdiction, such as the state of Mississippi, enacted or sought to administer a change in ""any voting qualification or prerequisite to voting, or standard, practice, or procedure,"" the state had to obtain preclearance, from the United States District Court for the District of Columbia or from the United States Attorney General, before the change could be enforced. Section 5 also provided that such a voting change could be enforced if it was submitted to the Attorney General and there was no objection by the Attorney General within 60 days. However, a United States Department of Justice (DOJ) regulation (28 CFR 51.37)--which had been upheld by the United States Supreme Court--effectively postponed the 60-day period when the DOJ requested additional information, until the requested information was received. With respect to the state-court litigation in question, an individual and some other private parties (the ""state plaintiffs"") filed suit in October 2001 in the Chancery Court for the First Judicial District of Hinds County, Mississippi, and asked the Chancery Court to issue a redistricting plan for the 2002 congressional elections. After the Mississippi Supreme Court, in denying petitions for writs of prohibition and mandamus, had decided that the Chancery Court had jurisdiction to issue such a plan, the Chancery Court adopted a congressional redistricting plan which had been proposed by the state plaintiffs. On December 26, the state's attorney general submitted the plan to the DOJ for preclearance. However, on February 14, 2002, the DOJ requested additional information concerning the Mississippi Supreme Court's decision in favor of the Chancery Court's jurisdiction. The state's attorney general finished providing the additional information on February 20. Meanwhile, in November 2001, a different individual and some others (the ""federal plaintiffs"") had filed an action, in the United States District Court for the Southern District of Mississippi, against defendants including various state officials. The federal plaintiffs eventually asked the District Court to enjoin any state-court plan, which they asserted (1) would violate Article I, 4; and (2) in any event, could not be enforced until the state court's assertion of redistricting authority had been precleared under 5. Moreover, the federal plaintiffs asked the District Court (1) to order at-large elections pursuant to 2a(c)(5) and the Mississippi statute, or (2) to devise the District Court's own redistricting plan. On December 5, the District Court permitted the state plaintiffs to intervene and deferred ruling on a motion by the federal plaintiffs for a preliminary injunction (189 F Supp 2d 502). However, on February 4, 2002, the District Court promulgated a redistricting plan to be used in the absence of timely preclearance of the Chancery Court's plan (189 F Supp 2d 512). Then, on February 26, the District Court enjoined the state from using the Chancery Court's plan--and ordered the use of the District Court's own plan in the 2002 elections and all succeeding elections until the state produced a constitutional redistricting plan that had been precleared--as the District Court (1) said that the basis for this injunction and order was the failure of the timely preclearance, under 5, of the Chancery Court's plan; and (2) added, as an ""alternative holding"" in the event that the District Court was determined on appeal to have erred under 5, a conclusion that Article I, 4 of the Constitution prohibited the Chancery Court from issuing a redistricting plan without express authorization from the state's legislature (189 F Supp 2d 548).",lexis

The Federal Government did not rely solely upon evidence regarding the alleged use or threat of physical force, or threat of institutionalization, but argued that the farm operators had made the laborers ""psychological"" hostages who had been ""brainwashed"" by coercive measures such as (1) denial of pay, (2) subjection to substandard living conditions, and (3) isolation from others. After the District Court instructed the jury by using a definition of ""involuntary servitude"" that included situations involving ""either physical or other coercion, or a combination thereof,"" the jury convicted each of the farm operators of violating one or both statutes. On appeal, a panel of the United States Court of Appeals for the Sixth Circuit initially affirmed the convictions.

The statute defined (1) ""partial birth abortion"" as a procedure in which one ""partially delivers vaginally a living unborn child before killing the unborn child and completing the delivery,"" and (2) ""partially delivers vaginally a living unborn child"" as intentionally delivering into the vagina a living unborn child, or a substantial portion thereof. A live delivery procedure known as dilation and extraction (D&X) was ordinarily associated with the term ""partial birth abortion."" However, the most common abortion procedure, which was known as dilation and evacuation (D&E), sometimes involved live delivery of at least some bodily part. A Nebraska physician who performed abortions in a clinical setting brought in the United States District Court for the District of Nebraska a lawsuit (1) seeking a declaration that the statute violated the Federal Constitution, and (2) asking for an injunction forbidding enforcement of the statute. The District Court held that the statute was unconstitutional (11 F Supp 2d 1099), and the United States District Court for the Eighth Circuit affirmed (192 F3d 1142).",lexis
"Respondent Edward Schad was convicted of first-degree murder and sentenced to death. After an extensive series of state- and federal-court proceedings concluded with this Court's denial of respondent's petitions for certiorari and for rehearing, the Ninth Circuit declined to issue its mandate as normally required by Federal Rule of Appellate Procedure 41(d)(2)(D). The Ninth Circuit instead, sua sponte, construed respondent's motion to stay the mandate pending the Ninth Circuit's decision in a separate en banc case as a motion to reconsider a motion that it had denied six months earlier. Based on its review of that previously rejected motion, the court issued a stay a few days before respondent's scheduled execution. Even assuming, as we did in Bell v. Thompson, 545 U. S. 794 (2005), that Rule 41(d)(2)(D) admits of any exceptions, the Ninth Circuit did not demonstrate that exceptional circumstances justified withholding its mandate.

"Prior to amendment in 1968, the New York transfer tax applied equally to in-state transfers of securities (or other in-state taxable events) regardless of whether the transaction involved an out-of-state or an in-state sale. As amended in 1968, the statute imposes a higher tax on in-state transfers of securities resulting from out-of-state sales than those resulting from in-state sales by affording a 50% reduction in the tax rate to transactions by nonresidents when the transaction involves an in-state sale, and by limiting the total tax liability of any taxpayer (resident or nonresident) to $ 350 when the transaction involves an in-state sale. Certain ""regional"" stock exchanges located outside New York filed an action in a New York state court against the State Tax Commission of New York, alleging that the amended statute unconstitutionally discriminated against interstate commerce.

"In 2012 Alabama redrew the boundaries of the State's 105 House districts and 35 Senate districts. In doing so, while Alabama sought to achieve numerous traditional districting objectives-e.g., compactness, not splitting counties or precincts, minimizing change, and protecting incumbents-it placed yet greater importance on two goals: (1) minimizing a district's deviation from precisely equal population, by keeping any deviation less than 1% of the theoretical ideal; and (2) seeking to avoid retrogression with respect to racial minorities' ""ability to elect their preferred candidates of choice"" under ¬ß5 of the Voting Rights Act of 1965, 52 U. S. C. ¬ß10304(b), by maintaining roughly the same black population percentage in existing majority-minority districts. Appellants-Alabama Legislative Black Caucus (Caucus), Alabama Democratic Conference (Conference), and others-claim that Alabama's new district boundaries create a ""racial gerrymander"" in violation of the Fourteenth Amendment's Equal Protection Clause. After a bench trial, the three-judge District Court ruled (2 to 1) for the State. It recognized that electoral districting violates the Equal Protection Clause when race is the ""predominant"" consideration in deciding ""to place a significant number of voters within or without a particular district,"" Miller v.

"In 1985, a small California research company called Cetus began to develop methods for quantifying blood-borne levels of human immunodeficiency virus (HIV), the virus that causes AIDS. A Nobel Prize winning technique developed at Cetus known as PCR was an integral part of these efforts. In 1988, Cetus began to collaborate with scientists at Stanford University‚Äôs Department of Infectious Diseases to test the efficacy of new AIDS drugs. Dr. Holodniy joined Stanford as a research fellow in the department around that time. When he did so, he signed an agreement stating that he ‚Äúagree[d] to assign‚Äù to Stanford his ‚Äúright, title and interest in‚Äù inventions resulting from his employment there. Holodniy‚Äôs supervisor arranged for him to conduct research at Cetus to learn about PCR. As a condition of gaining access to Cetus, Holodniy was required to sign an agreement stating that he ‚Äúwill assign and do[es] hereby assign‚Äù to Cetus his ‚Äúright, title and interest in ‚Ä¶ the ideas, inventions, and improvements‚Äù made ‚Äúas a consequence of [his] access‚Äù to Cetus. Working with Cetus employees, Holodniy devised a PCR-based procedure for measuring the amount of HIV in a patient‚Äôs blood. Upon returning to Stanford, he and other Stanford employees tested the procedure. Stanford secured three patents to the measurement process. Roche Molecular Systems acquired Cetus‚Äôs PCR-related assets. After conducting clinical trials on the HIV quantification method developed at Cetus, Roche commercialized the procedure. Today, its HIV test kits are used worldwide. The University and Small Business Patent Procedures Act of 1980 (Bayh-Dole Act or Act) allocates rights in federally funded ‚Äúsubject invention[s]‚Äù between the Federal Government and federal contractors. 35 U. S. C. ¬ß¬ß201(e), (c), 202(a). The Act defines ‚Äúsubject invention‚Äù as ‚Äúany invention of the contractor conceived or first actually reduced to practice in the performance of work under a funding agreement,‚Äù ¬ß201(e), and provides that contractors may ‚Äúelect to retain title to any subject invention,‚Äù ¬ß202(a). Because some of Stanford‚Äôs research on the HIV measurement technique was funded by the National Institutes of Health (NIH), the Bayh-Dole Act applied. In accordance with the Act‚Äôs requirements, Stanford notified NIH that it was electing to retain title to the invention and conferred on the Government a license to use the patented procedure. Petitioner, the Board of Trustees of Stanford University, filed suit against respondents (Roche), claiming that their HIV test kits infringed Stanford‚Äôs patents. Roche responded that Holodniy‚Äôs agreement with Cetus gave it co-ownership of the procedure, and thus Stanford lacked standing to sue it for patent infringement. Stanford countered that Holodniy had no rights to assign because the University had superior rights under the Bayh-Dole Act. The District Court agreed with Stanford and held that under the Bayh-Dole Act, Holodniy had no rights to assign to Cetus. The Court of Appeals for the Federal Circuit disagreed, concluding that Holodniy‚Äôs agreement with Cetus assigned his rights to Cetus, and thus to Roche. It also found that the Bayh-Dole Act did not automatically void an inventor‚Äôs rights in federally funded inventions. Thus, the Act did not extinguish Roche‚Äôs ownership interest in the invention, and Stanford was deprived of standing.",lexis

In a civil action by the United States to prevent and restrain violation of the anti-trust law, the United States corporation sought to justify the restraints imposed by the agreement as reasonable, and therefore no violation of the Anti-trust Act, on the ground that such agreements were ancillary to the legal main transaction between itself and its coadventurer and an exercise of the right to license the use of its trademark; and also on the ground that tariffs and import quota restrictions operate to exclude the products of the United States company from European markets and the products of the foreign companies from United States markets.",lexis

"A California property owner submitted a tentative residential subdivision plan to a California county planning commission, whose rejection of the plan was affirmed on appeal by the county board of supervisors. The board criticized the plan for insufficient access to a public street, and for failure to provide adequately for sewer, police, and water services. The owner filed for declaratory and monetary relief in California Superior Court, alleging, after amendment, that (1) by the county's denial, the county had restricted the property to open-space agricultural use and had appropriated the entire economic use of the owner's property for the sole purpose of providing a public open-space buffer; (2) any application for a zone change, variance, or other relief would be futile; and (3) the owner had exhausted all administrative remedies. The Superior Court, however, sustained a demurrer to the owner's amended complaint, reasoning that (1) the property had other obvious uses than agriculture, so that the owner's attempt to overcome the defect by alleging that other uses were no longer possible had to be rejected; and (2) monetary damages were not recoverable in California for inverse condemnation. On appeal, the Court of Appeal of California, Third Appellate District, affirmed, expressing the view that (1) in California, the remedy for a taking by land use regulation is to have the regulation set aside as unconstitutional, so that a landowner cannot recover in inverse condemnation due to land use regulation; and (2) even if California did permit an inverse condemnation remedy in these circumstances, the owner had failed to allege sufficient facts to state a cause of action, for the denial of the particular subdivision plan could not be equated with the refusal to permit any development.

"Illinois' Home Services Program (Rehabilitation Program) allows Medicaid recipients who would normally need institutional care to hire a ""personal assistant"" (PA) to provide homecare services.

Customers control most aspects of the employment relationship, including the hiring, firing, training, supervising, and disciplining of PAs; they also define the PA's duties by proposing a ""Service Plan."" Other than compensating PAs, the State's involvement in employment matters is minimal.

A superseding indictment was subsequently issued, which indictment charged a conspiracy to distribute and to possess with intent to distribute a ""detectable amount"" of cocaine and cocaine base. The superseding indictment did not allege any of the threshold levels of drug quantity that led to enhanced penalties under 21 USCS 841(b)(1)(A), which prescribed a term of imprisonment of not more than life for drug offenses involving at least 50 grams of cocaine base. After the accused were convicted, they received sentences based on a Federal District Court's finding that each of the accused was responsible for at least 500 grams of cocaine base. The accused did not object in the District Court to the fact that the sentences were based on a quantity not alleged in the indictment.

After a trial, the District Court (1) held that the provision of law-library privileges and the assignment of unit attorneys did not meet the state's obligation, under the Federal Constitution, to provide indigent death row inmates with meaningful access to the courts, because (a) death row inmates have a limited amount of time to prepare their petitions, (b) their cases are unusually complex, and (c) their preparation for impending death interferes with their ability to pursue their claims adequately; (2) ruled that providing for the appointment of counsel after a petition was filed did not cure the problem, because inmates would not receive the assistance of counsel in the critical stages of developing their claims; and (3) ordered Virginia to develop a program to provide for the appointment of individual counsel for such inmates on request to assist them in pursuing postconviction relief in the state courts (668 F Supp 511).

Young subsequently filed this federal lawsuit, claiming that UPS acted unlawfully in refusing to accommodate her pregnancy-related lifting restriction. She brought only a disparate-treatment claim of discrimination, which a plaintiff can prove either by direct evidence that a workplace policy, practice, or decision relies expressly on a protected characteristic, or by using the burden-shifting framework set forth in McDonnell Douglas Corp. v. Green, 411 U. S. 792. Under that framework, the plaintiff has ""the initial burden"" of ""establishing a prima face case"" of discrimination. Id., at 802. If she carries her burden, the employer must have an opportunity ""to articulate some legitimate, non-discriminatory reason[s] for"" the difference in treatment. Ibid. If the employer articulates such reasons, the plaintiff then has ""an opportunity to prove by a preponderance of the evidence that the reasons ... were a pretext for discrimination."" Texas Dept. of Community Affairs v. Burdine, 450 U. S. 248, 253. After discovery, UPS sought summary judgment. In reply, Young presented several favorable facts that she believed she could prove. In particular, she pointed to UPS policies that accommodated workers who were injured on the job, had disabilities covered by the Americans with Disabilities Act of 1990 (ADA), or had lost Department of Transportation (DOT) certifications. Pursuant to these policies, Young contended, UPS had accommodated several individuals whose disabilities created work restrictions similar to hers. She argued that these policies showed that UPS discriminated against its pregnant employees because it had a light-duty-for-injury policy for numerous ""other persons,"" but not for pregnant workers. UPS responded that, since Young did not fall within the on-the-job injury, ADA, or DOT categories, it had not discriminated against Young on the basis of pregnancy, but had treated her just as it treated all ""other"" relevant ""persons."" The District Court granted UPS summary judgment, concluding, inter alia, that Young could not make out a prima facie case of discrimination under McDonnell Douglas. The court found that those with whom Young had compared herself-those falling within the onthe-job, DOT, or ADA categories-were too different to qualify as ""similarly situated comparator[s]."" The Fourth Circuit affirmed.",lexis

"The State of Indiana identified several state interests that arguably justified the burdens that SEA 483 imposed on voters and potential voters. The first interest was election modernization. The Court noted both the National Voter Registration Act of 1993, 42 U.S.C.S. _ 1973gg et seq., and the Help America Vote Act of 2002 contained provisions consistent with a state's choice to use government-issued photo identification as a relevant source of information concerning a citizen's eligibility to vote. The second interest was the risk of voter fraud. The Court held that there was no question about the legitimacy or importance of the State's interest in counting only the votes of eligible voters. It also held that inflated voter rolls provided a neutral and nondiscriminatory reason supporting the State's decision to require photo identification. While closely related to the State's interest in preventing voter fraud, public confidence in the integrity of the electoral process had independent significance, because it encouraged citizen participation in the democratic process. These interests were sufficient to outweigh the limited burden on voters' rights.",lexis

The United States opposed the granting of relief, alleging that the use of the literacy test had the effect of denying or abridging the right to vote on account of race or color because it placed a specially onerous burden on the county's Negro citizens for whom the county had maintained separate and inferior schools.

In Brown v Felsen (1979) 442 US 127, 60 L Ed 2d 767, 99 S Ct 2205, the Supreme Court held that under a predecessor of 523(a)(2)(A), the doctrine of claim preclusion did not prevent a Bankruptcy Court from looking beyond the record of a state-court proceeding and the documents which had terminated that proceeding (a stipulation and consent judgment) in order to decide whether the debt then at issue (a debt embodied in the stipulation and consent judgment) was a debt for money obtained by fraud. In the case at hand, two purchasers of a company sued the company's two sellers, who were husband and wife, in a North Carolina state court for, among other matters, alleged fraud in connection with the sale. In 1995, the parties settled the lawsuit. The settlement agreement and related documents (1) included recitations that the parties did not admit to any liability or wrongdoing; (2) released all related claims; and (3) provided for some payments to the buyers, including payments on a $ 100,000 promissory note.

The county District Court overruled the Illinois corporation's pleading challenging the venue of the suit in McLennan County, when, at a preliminary venue hearing, the plaintiff, relying upon a stipulation of the parties that the Illinois corporation was a foreign corporation transacting business in Texas with a local agent in McLennan County, asserted venue under an exception to the general venue statute for suits against foreign corporations which allows suits against foreign corporations such as the Illinois corporation to be brought in any county where such corporation has an agency or representative. The Illinois corporation's subsequent appeal to the Court of Civil Appeals of Texas presented the single question whether the exception to the general venue statute asserted in the county District Court was unconstitutionally discriminatory against foreign corporations because it permits a foreign corporation to be venue bound upon the plaintiff's proving the existence within the venue county of an agent of the defendant foreign corporation, while another exception to the general venue statute for suits against domestic corporations allows such a corporation to be venue bound by the plaintiff proving at a preliminary venue hearing not only that the domestic corporation has an agency or representative in the county of suit, but also, by a preponderance of the evidence, that the plaintiff has a cause of action.

"While the appointments clause of Art II, 2, cl 2 of the Federal Constitution requires that principal officers of the United States must be appointed by the President with the advice and consent of the Senate, the appointments clause authorizes Congress to vest the appointment of inferior officers ""in the President alone, in the Courts of Law, or in the Heads of Departments. ""Several court-martial cases involved the question whether the two then-serving civilian judges of the Coast Guard Court of Criminal Appeals, an intermediate court in the military justice system, had been validly appointed.

Under 29 USCS 412, such 101(a)(2) rights are enforceable by a private right of action, but there is no federal statute of limitations expressly applicable to such a 101(a)(2) claim.

The union and its officers then moved for dismissal or for summary judgment and argued that the 102(a)(2) claim was time barred, because, in the absence of an expressly applicable statute of limitations, the court ought to borrow the 6-month limit, under 10(b) of the National Labor Relations Act (NLRA) (29 USCS 160(b)), for the filing with the National Labor Relations Board of a charge of an unfair labor practice defined in 8 of the NLRA (29 USCS 158).

The DOT provided the SSA with the names of licensed pilots, and the SSA, in turn, provided the DOT with a spreadsheet containing information on those pilots who had also received disability benefits. Respondent's name appeared on the spreadsheet, and an investigation led to his admission that he had intentionally withheld information about his HIV status from the FAA. His pilot certificate was revoked, and he was indicted for making false statements to a Government agency. He pleaded guilty and was fined and sentenced to probation.

"A couple took out a loan for $ 119,000, which loan was accompanied by a deed of trust granting the creditors a lien on two parcels of farmland owned by the couple.

The Bankruptcy Court denied the requested relief, as the court (1) assumed that the land in question had been or would be abandoned by the bankruptcy trustee, since the couple otherwise would not have standing to bring such a proceeding, and (2) concluded that the land was not property in which the estate had an interest and therefore was not covered by 506(d) (87 BR 676).

Later in the prosecution the witness again refused to answer eleven questions requiring her to identify certain other persons as Communists, expressing her willingness so to identify others only if such identification would not hurt them.

"The question for decision is whether the Federal Arbitration Act, 9 U. S. C. ¬ß1 et seq., preempts a rule of California law that invalidates contractual waivers of the right to assert representative claims under California‚Äôs Labor Code Private Attorneys General Act of 2004, Cal. Lab. Code ¬ß2698 et seq. PAGA enlists employees as private attorneys general to enforce California labor law. By its terms, PAGA authorizes any ‚Äúaggrieved employee‚Äù to initiate an action against a former employer ‚Äúon behalf of himself or herself and other current or former employees‚Äù to obtain civil penalties that previously could have been recovered only by the State in an enforcement action brought by California‚Äôs Labor and Workforce Development Agency (LWDA). California precedent holds that a PAGA suit is a ‚Äú ‚Äòrepresentative action‚Äô ‚Äù in which the employee plaintiff sues as an ‚Äú ‚Äòagent or proxy‚Äô ‚Äù of the State. Iskanian v. CLS Transp. Los Angeles, LLC, 59 Cal. 4th 348, 380. California precedent also interprets the statute to contain what is effectively a rule of claim joinder‚Äîallowing a party to unite multiple claims against an opposing party in a single action. An employee with PAGA standing may ‚Äúseek any civil penalties the state can, including penalties for violations involving employees other than the PAGA litigant herself.‚Äù ZB, N. A. v. Superior Court, 8 Cal. 5th 175, 185. Respondent Angie Moriana filed a PAGA action against her former employer Viking River Cruises, alleging a California Labor Code violation. She also asserted a wide array of other violations allegedly sustained by other Viking employees. Moriana‚Äôs employment contract with Viking contained a mandatory arbitration agreement. Important here, that agreement contained both a ‚ÄúClass Action Waiver‚Äù‚Äîproviding that the parties could not bring any dispute as a class, collective, or representative action under PAGA‚Äîand a severability clause‚Äî specifying that if the waiver was found invalid, such a dispute would presumptively be litigated in court. Under the severability clause, any ‚Äúportion‚Äù of the waiver that remained valid would be ‚Äúenforced in arbitration.‚Äù Viking moved to compel arbitration of Moriana‚Äôs individual PAGA claim and to dismiss her other PAGA claims. Applying California‚Äôs Iskanian precedent, the California courts denied that motion, holding that categorical waivers of PAGA standing are contrary to California policy and that PAGA claims cannot be split into arbitrable ‚Äúindividual‚Äù claims and nonarbitrable ‚Äúrepresentative‚Äù claims.

"The government instituted an action in the United States District Court for the District of New Jersey, seeking to enjoin the proposed merger of two of three small, competing commercial banks located in the City of Phillipsburg, New Jersey, as a violation of 7 of the Clayton Act, prohibiting certain corporate mergers where their effect may be substantially to lessen competition in any line of commerce in any section of the country. The Comptroller of the Currency had previously approved the merger pursuant to the Bank Merger Act of 1966, which authorizes approval of a bank merger having anticompetitive effects if such effects are outweighed in the public interest by the probable effect of the transaction in meeting the convenience and needs of the community to be served. The government's contention that the relevant geographic market for judging the anticompetitive effects of the proposed merger should be the area consisting of Phillipsburg and the adjacent city of Easton, Pennsylvania, which area included 7 competing banks, was rejected by the District Court, which instead concluded that the relevant geographic market was an area approximately 4 times larger, with 18 banks. The District Court, while looking to commercial banking as the relevant product market under the Clayton Act, also considered submarkets involving competition between the merging banks and other types of financial institutions, such as savings and loan associations and insurance and finance companies. The District Court dismissed the government's complaint, holding that there was no showing that the merger would have any anticompetitive effect, and that any de minimis anticompetitive effect in the narrowly drawn market proposed by the government would be clearly outweighed by the convenience and needs of Phillipsburg (306 F Supp 645).",lexis

"In 2012 Alabama redrew the boundaries of the State's 105 House districts and 35 Senate districts. In doing so, while Alabama sought to achieve numerous traditional districting objectives-e.g., compactness, not splitting counties or precincts, minimizing change, and protecting incumbents-it placed yet greater importance on two goals: (1) minimizing a district's deviation from precisely equal population, by keeping any deviation less than 1% of the theoretical ideal; and (2) seeking to avoid retrogression with respect to racial minorities' ""ability to elect their preferred candidates of choice"" under ¬ß5 of the Voting Rights Act of 1965, 52 U. S. C. ¬ß10304(b), by maintaining roughly the same black population percentage in existing majority-minority districts. Appellants-Alabama Legislative Black Caucus (Caucus), Alabama Democratic Conference (Conference), and others-claim that Alabama's new district boundaries create a ""racial gerrymander"" in violation of the Fourteenth Amendment's Equal Protection Clause. After a bench trial, the three-judge District Court ruled (2 to 1) for the State. It recognized that electoral districting violates the Equal Protection Clause when race is the ""predominant"" consideration in deciding ""to place a significant number of voters within or without a particular district,"" Miller v.

In ruling against appellants, it made four critical determinations: (1) that both appellants had argued ""that the Aots as a whole constitute racial gerrymanders,"" and that the Conference had also argued that the State had racially gerrymandered Senate Districts 7, 11, 22, and 26; (2) that the Conference lacked standing to make its racial gerrymandering claims; (3) that, in any event, appellants' claims must fail because race ""was not the predominant motivating factor"" in making the redistricting decisions; and (4) that, even were it wrong about standing and predominance, these claims must fail because any predominant use of race was ""narrowly tailored"" to serve a ""compelling state interest"" in avoiding retrogression under ¬ß5.",lexis
"Part of the Trade Act of 1974 (19 USCS 2271-2321) allows extra unemployment benefits for workers who lose their jobs because of competition from imports, provided they have had at least 26 weeks of qualifying employment in the previous 52 weeks, and allows the Secretary of Labor to delegate eligibility determinations to certain state agencies. The Secretary issued guidelines, later prospectively superseded by statute, which advised those agencies not to count sick leave, vacation, military leave, or the like toward the 26-week requirement. A union, together with some of its members who had been denied benefits under those guidelines or who faced appeals from awards made in spite of them, filed an action for declaratory and injunctive relief in the United States District Court for the District of Columbia, in which they contended that the guidelines violated the provisions of the Trade Act and, insofar as they affected military leave, violated other federal laws. The District Court (1) rejected the Secretary's contention that 19 USCS 2311(d), which makes entitlement determinations reviewable only in the same manner and to the same extent as determinations under the applicable state law, precluded federal jurisdiction over this action; and (2) rendered summary judgment in favor of the union, (a) declaring that sick leave and the like should be counted toward the 26-week requirement, for purposes of determining eligibility for benefits prior to the effective date of the superseding statute, and (b) ordering the Secretary to direct state agencies to review all denials of benefits in that period (568 F Supp 1047). The United States Court of Appeals for the District of Columbia Circuit reversed without reaching the merits of the case, holding (1) that the union lacked standing to bring the action either on behalf of nonmembers affected by the guidelines, for whom it was not an appropriate representative, or on behalf of its members, since it had not alleged any injury to itself or to the members' associational interest; and (2) that the individual members could not maintain the action because the state agencies which had processed their claims, and which were necessary parties to the action under state judicial review rules made applicable by 2311(d), had not been joined as defendants (241 US App DC 106, 746 F2d 839).",lexis

The testifying defendants claimed that they had known nothing about the conspiracy and that they were unaware of the contents of containers in which drugs were found. The nontestifying defendants' lawyers argued that the nontestifying defendants were innocent and were ignorant of the contents of the containers. At various points during the proceeding, each of the defendants moved for severance under Rule 14 of the Federal Rules of Criminal Procedure--which permits a District Court to grant a severance of defendants if it appears that a defendant is prejudiced by a joinder--on the ground of mutually antagonistic defenses. The District Court denied the motions. However, the District Court instructed the jury that (1) the prosecution had the burden of proving beyond a reasonable doubt that each defendant had committed the crimes with which he or she was charged, (2) the jury must give separate consideration to each individual defendant and to each separate charge, (3) each defendant was entitled to have his or her case determined from his or her own conduct and from the evidence that might be applicable to him or her, (4) attorneys' opening and closing arguments are not evidence, and (5) the jury should draw no inferences from a defendant's exercise of the right to silence. All of the defendants were convicted of conspiracy and appealed their convictions to the United States Court of Appeals for the Seventh Circuit. Three of the defendants based their appeal on the claim that the denial of their severance motions was an abuse of discretion.

At trial, the court granted the defendants' motion for a directed verdict on the plaintiff's claim that documents purporting to grant the defendants an option to develop the plaintiff's copyrighted work commercially had been forged by one of the defendants; the jury returned a verdict against the plaintiff on all remaining claims. The defendants thereafter moved for sanctions, against the plaintiff's law firm and against both members of the firm individually, under Rule 11 of the Federal Rules of Civil Procedure--which provides, among other things, that a court shall impose an appropriate sanction upon the ""person who signed"" a pleading, motion, or other paper which was not ""well grounded in fact""--on the ground that the forgery claim had no basis in fact and had not been investigated sufficiently by counsel. The District Court granted the motion and imposed a monetary sanction under Rule 11 against the law firm (111 FRD 637). Two weeks later, the law firm was dissolved, and the attorney who had not signed any of the court papers moved in the District Court to relieve the firm of the sanction.

"Under a contract with the Federal Government, an engineering company managed oil drilling operations at a federal petroleum reserve in California.

For the years 1975 through 1981, California--in two deficiency notices issued in July 1978 and December 1982--assessed approximately $ 14 million in sales and use taxes against the contractor. At the direction of the Federal Government, the contractor, arguing that California had misapplied its own tax law, applied to the California board of equalization for an administrative redetermination of the assessments. With minor exceptions, the board denied each of the contractor's reassessment claims. Thereafter, the contractor paid the assessments under protest, using funds provided by the Federal Government. The contractor then filed timely actions on both claims against California in California state court. In January 1988, California and the contractor stipulated to (1) a $ 3 million refund for erroneous assessments on property purchased by the contractors and installed by the Federal Government; and (2) dismissal of both actions without prejudice. In May 1988, the Federal Government, seeking a refund of the remaining $ 11 million in sales and use taxes paid by the contractor, plus interest, filed suit against California in the United States District Court for the Eastern District of California.

In 1987, some police officers in Idaho made a warrantless arrest of a suspect by surrounding the house in which he resided and ordering him to come out. As the suspect came out, he had an epileptic seizure, fell on a concrete walk, and was seriously injured.

"Corning Glass Works, which operates plants both in New York and in Pennsylvania, paid its night inspectors, who were all male, significantly higher wages than its day inspectors, who were all female and performed the same tasks. The employer continued this practice after the effective date (June 11, 1964) of the Equal Pay Act of 1963 (29 USCS 206(d)(1)), which prohibits sex discrimination by an employer in the payment of wages for equal work. Beginning in June 1966, the employer started to open up jobs on the night shift to women. Previously separate male and female seniority lists were consolidated and women became eligible to exercise their seniority, on the same basis as men, to bid for the higher paid night inspection jobs as vacancies occurred. On January 20, 1969, a new collective bargaining agreement went into effect, establishing a new ""job evaluation"" system for setting wage rates; the agreement abolished for the future the separate base wages for day and night shift inspectors and imposed a uniform base wage for inspectors exceeding the wage rate for the night shift previously in effect. All inspectors hired after January 20, 1969, were to receive the same base wage, whatever their sex or shift. The collective bargaining agreement further provided for a higher ""red circle"" rate for employees hired prior to the date of the agreement, when working as inspectors on the night shift; this ""red circle"" rate served essentially to perpetuate the differential in base wages between day and night inspectors.",lexis
"Petitioner Gerald Groff is an Evangelical Christian who believes for religious reasons that Sunday should be devoted to worship and rest. In 2012, Groff took a mail delivery job with the United States Postal Service. Groff‚Äôs position generally did not involve Sunday work, but that changed after USPS agreed to begin facilitating Sunday deliveries for Amazon. To avoid the requirement to work Sundays on a rotating basis, Groff transferred to a rural USPS station that did not make Sunday deliveries. After Amazon deliveries began at that station as well, Groff remained unwilling to work Sundays, and USPS redistributed Groff‚Äôs Sunday deliveries to other USPS staff. Groff received ‚Äúprogressive discipline‚Äù for failing to work on Sundays, and he eventually resigned.

"A corporation owned two patents for an improved magnetic rodless cylinder, which was a piston-driven device that relied on magnets to move objects in a conveying system. During the patent prosecution proceedings, the application for the first patent was amended after the patent examiner rejected the initial application, on the grounds that the exact method of operation was unclear and that some claims had been made in an impermissible way. The second patent was also amended during a re-examination proceeding. Both amended applications added some references to prior art. Both amended patents added a new limitation, to the effect that the inventions contained a pair of sealing rings. The amended second patent added a further limitation as to the composition of the outer shell or ""sleeve"" of the device. After the corporation began selling the rodless cylinder, a competitor entered the market with a similar device, except that (1) the competitor's device employed a single sealing ring, and (2) the competitor's sleeve was made of a different material. Although the competitor's device did not fall within the literal claims of either of the corporation's patents, the corporation contended that the device was so similar that it infringed the patents under the doctrine of equivalents, which allows a patentee to claim insubstantial alterations that were not captured in drafting the original patent claim but which could be created through trivial changes. The corporation brought suit against the competitor in the United States District Court for the District of Massachusetts. Prior to trial, the District Court granted the corporation partial summary judgment, having found infringement on one of the patents under the doctrine of equivalents.

The residents' complaint included allegations to the effect that the officials had violated the residents' rights under the Federal Constitution's Fourth Amendment, in that allegedly (1) in 1993, a magistrate judge had issued a warrant authorizing the search of the ranch with appurtenant structures, excluding the residence, for evidence of the taking of wildlife in violation of federal laws; (2) about a week later, a multiple-vehicle caravan consisting of government agents and a crew of photographers and reporters from a cable news network had proceeded to a point near the ranch; (3) the agents had executed the warrant; (4) the agents later explained that over the course of the day, ""the officers"" had searched the ranch and its outbuildings pursuant to the authority conferred by the warrant; and (5) the agents further explained that the media crew had accompanied and observed the officers and had recorded the officers' conduct in executing the warrant. However, the District Court, in granting summary judgment in favor of the federal officials, ruled that the officials were entitled to qualified immunity, as the court expressed the view that at the time of the alleged incident, there was no clearly established law protecting individuals from the commercial recording of a search of their premises. On appeal, the United States Court of Appeals for the Ninth Circuit, in reversing in pertinent part and in ordering a remand, expressed the view that--viewing the evidence in the light most favorable to the residents for purposes of decision--(1) the search of the ranch violated the Fourth Amendment, and (2) the federal officials were not entitled to qualified immunity (129 F3d 505, 1997 US App LEXIS 31848).",lexis

"In 1970, the National Labor Relations Board certified a union as the collective bargaining agent for an employer's production and maintenance employees. In 1979, a collective bargaining agreement between the union and the employer expired, and after negotiations toward a new agreement failed, the union commenced an economic strike. Five employees immediately crossed the picket line and reported for work. During the strike, the employer hired 29 permanent replacement employees to replace the 22 striking employees. The union subsequently ended the strike, offering to accept unconditionally the employer's last contract offer. The employer informed the union that the offer was no longer open. At that time, the bargaining unit consisted of 19 strikers, 25 permanent replacements, and the 5 employees who had crossed the picket line. The employer withdrew recognition from the union and refused to bargain further, expressing doubt that the union was supported by a majority of the bargaining unit. The employer also refused to provide the union with information concerning the total number of bargaining-unit employees on the payroll and the job classification and seniority of each employee. The union filed an unfair labor practice charge with the Board. After an investigation, the General Counsel issued a complaint, alleging that the employer's withdrawal of recognition, its refusal to execute a contract embodying the terms of its last offer, and its failure to provide the union with employee information violated 8(a)(1) and 8(a)(5) of the National Labor Relations Act (29 USCS 158(a)(1), 158(a)(5)). The employer defended its conduct by asserting that it had a reasonably based, good-faith doubt of the union's majority status. The administrative law judge found for the employer and dismissed the complaint. The Board reversed, holding that the employer offered insufficient evidence to rebut the presumption of the union's continuing majority status; regarding the hiring of striker replacements, the Board refused to presume that the replacements opposed the union. The Board determined that the employer had violated 8(a)(1) and 8(a)(5) and ordered the employer to bargain with the union upon request, provide employee information, execute a collective bargaining agreement, and make the bargaining-unit employees whole for whatever losses they had suffered as a result of the employer's failure to execute a contract (287 NLRB No. 35). The United States Court of Appeals for the Fifth Circuit refused to enforce the Board's order; holding that the employer was justified in doubting the union's majority status, the Court of Appeals rejected the Board's decision not to presume that striker replacements opposed the union (859 F2d 362).",lexis

"Under the standard of New York Times Co. v Sullivan (1964) 376 US 254, 11 L Ed 2d 686, 84 S Ct 710, proof of actual malice, which is defined as publication of a statement with knowledge of its falsity or reckless disregard as to its truth or falsity, is required, by the Federal Constitution's First Amendment, for recovery by a public figure in a defamation action. A psychoanalyst was terminated from his position as projects director of archives containing materials about Sigmund Freud, including his writings, letters, and personal library, after the psychoanalyst, having become disillusioned with Freudian psychology, advanced his theories of Freud in a lecture before a psychoanalytical society. Subsequently, an author, after tape recording a series of interviews with the psychoanalyst, wrote an article on his relationship with the archives for a magazine. After the article, which contained lengthy passages that were in quotation marks and were attributed to the psychoanalyst, was published in the magazine, a book publisher, with knowledge of at least the allegation by the psychoanalyst, who alleged that there were errors in some of the quoted passages, that the article contained defamatory material, published the article as a book, which portrayed the psychoanalyst in an unflattering light. The psychoanalyst brought an action for libel under California law in the United States District Court for the Northern District of California against the author, the magazine, and the book publisher. With respect to each of six quotations attributed to the psychoanalyst in the article, no identical statement appeared in the more than 40 hours of the author's taped interviews with the psychoanalyst. However, the author alleged that not all of her discussions with the psychoanalyst were recorded on tape. The District Court, finding that the allegedly fabricated quotations were either substantially true or were rational interpretations of ambiguous conversations, granted summary judgment for the author, magazine, and book publisher, where the parties had agreed that the psychoanalyst was a public figure and so could escape summary judgment only if the evidence in the record would permit a reasonable finder of fact, by clear and convincing evidence, to conclude that the article contained defamatory material that was published with actual malice (686 F Supp 1396). On appeal, the United States Court of Appeals for the Ninth Circuit, affirming the District Court judgment, concluded that one of the quotations was not defamatory, and that, under the incremental harm doctrine--under which the incremental reputational harm inflicted by allegedly defamatory statements beyond the harm imposed by the nonactionable remainder of the publication containing the statements is measured to determine whether the incremental harm is sufficient to be actionable--the quotation would not be actionable (895 F2d 1536).",lexis
"Under the Aid to Families with Dependent Children (AFDC) program, the Federal Government partially reimburses states that provide financial assistance to families with needy dependent children, as long as the states administer their assistance plans in conformity with federal statutes (42 USCS 601-615) and United States Department of Health and Human Services' (HHS) regulations. Although the federal statute defines neither term, it requires the consideration of a family's ""income"" and ""resources"" when determining whether the family is needy (42 USCS 602(a)(7)(A)), and prohibits the providing of AFDC benefits for any month in which either income or resources exceed state-prescribed limits (42 USCS 602(a)(7)(B)). Because income eligibility and resources eligibility are separately computed, and because state limits for the two generally differ, whether, and for how long, a family that acquired a sum of money was rendered ineligible for ADFC benefits at times depended on whether the sum was classified as income or as a resource. Under an amendment to the AFDC statute (42 USCS 602(a)(17)), if a given sum of money was treated as a resource, a family would be ineligible only until it spent enough of the sum to bring the amount down to the state's resource limit, but if the money was treated as income, a family would remain ineligible, no matter how much was spent, for the statutory period. In response to the AFDC amendment, the Virginia Department of Social Services revised its regulations to treat various lump-sum payments, including personal injury awards, as income rather than as resources, although the regulations continued to treat property damage awards as resources. Personal injury award recipients, who were disqualified from Virginia's AFDC program pursuant to the revised state regulations, filed a class-action suit in the United States District Court for the District of Western Virginia against the Secretary of HHS and the Commissioner of the Virginia Department of Social Services, alleging that the treatment of personal injury awards as income was inconsistent with the AFDC statute. The District Court granted summary judgment in the class' favor, holding that the common meaning of the term ""income"" precluded application of that term to personal injury awards, and that it was irrational to treat personal injury awards as income while treating awards for property loss as resources.

The bankruptcy trustee appointed for the corporation subsequently commenced an adversary proceeding in the United States Bankruptcy Court for the Northern District of Ohio, which proceeding sought to recover, among other transfers, the $ 20,000 paid by the officer to the IRS. Determining that the officer's unauthorized postpetition transfer could be avoided under 11 USCS 549(a) and recovered from the IRS under 11 USCS 550(a), the Bankruptcy Court entered judgment against the IRS in the amount of $ 20,000. The United States District Court for the Northern District of Ohio affirmed. The United States Court of Appeals for the Sixth Circuit, in affirming, rejected a defense, raised for the first time on appeal, that sovereign immunity barred the judgment entered against the government, as the court found that the sovereign immunity of the United States had been waived by 11 USCS 106(c)--which states that notwithstanding any assertion of sovereign immunity, (1) any provision of the Bankruptcy Code which contains the terms ""creditor,"" ""entity,"" or ""governmental unit"" applies to governmental units, and (2) a determination by the court of an issue arising under a Code provision binds governmental units (915 F2d 1049).",lexis
"Under Ohio law, sales of natural gas by state-regulated local public utilities were exempt from the state's general sales and use taxes that were applied to sales of natural gas by other in-state and out-of-state sellers. After the application by the state tax commissioner of the use tax to a company's natural gas purchases from independent out-of-state marketers for the company's plants in the state was sustained by the state board of tax appeals, the company appealed to the Supreme Court of Ohio on, among other contentions, the grounds that the state tax regime facially violated the Federal Constitution's commerce clause (Art I, 8, cl 3) and violated the equal protection clause of the Constitution's Fourteenth Amendment. After initially concluding that the tax regime did not violate the commerce clause, the Supreme Court of Ohio (1) stepped back to rule that because the company was not an out-of-state vendor of natural gas, the company lacked standing to bring the commerce clause challenge, and (2) dismissed the company's equal protection claim as submerged in its commerce clause argument (73 Ohio St 3d 29, 63 N.E.2d 188).",lexis
"A coal company owning several deep shaft mines in the midwestern United States was a member of a national multiemployer group which--with respect to the midwestern mines--bargained with a union representing its employees. Through its collective bargaining contract with the union, the coal company, along with the other members of the multiemployer group, agreed to contribute to the union's national pension and welfare trust fund established under 302(c)(5) of the Labor Management Relations Act (29 USCS 186(c)(5)). In accord with 302(c)(5), the trust funds were administered by three trustees, one selected by the union, one by the members of the multiemployer group, and one by the other two. Subsequently, the coal company opened a surface mine in Wyoming, but did not join the national multiemployer group with respect to that mine. Eventually, the union struck the mine and other western mines, attempting to compel the mine owners to establish a multiemployer bargaining unit and to agree to a new contract under which members of the new employer unit would contribute to the national trust funds. The union began separate negotiations with the coal company, but these negotiations came to an impasse while the union continued its strike at the surface mine. The coal company then filed unfair labor practice charges against the union with the National Labor Relations Board, charging that the union had attempted to coerce it illegally in the selection of its collective bargaining representative in violation of 8(b)(1)(B) of the National Labor Relations Act (29 USCS 158(b)(1)(B)), which makes it an unfair labor practice for a union ""to restrain or coerce ... an employer in the selection of his representatives for the purposes of collective bargaining or the adjustment of grievances."" The coal company took the view that any management-appointed trustee of a 302(c)(5) trust fund was a collective bargaining ""representative"" of the employer within the meaning of 8(b)(1)(B). The coal company reasoned that, since the management trustee of the national trust fund had already been selected by the multiemployer group, the union's insistence that it participate in the national trust fund with regard to the surface mine's employees constituted illegal coercion under 8(b)(1)(B). The Board concluded that the union had acted legally in bargaining to impasse and striking to obtain the coal company's participation in the national trust funds for the surface mine's employees, but the United States Court of Appeals for the Third Circuit reversed, holding that management-appointed trustees of a 302(c)(5) trust fund act as both fiduciaries of the employee-beneficiaries and as agents of the appointing employers, and that the union had acted in violation of 8(b)(1)(B) in exerting its economic power to induce the coal company to participate in the national trust funds with respect to the surface mine's employees (614 F2d 872).",lexis

The District Court denied the new trial motion, but rejected the government's argument that there was no duty to tender the victim's criminal record to the defense in the absence of an appropriate request, holding that even if it were assumed that the evidence was admissible, nevertheless it was not sufficiently material.

The Court of Appeals of Georgia reversed the conviction because of an erroneous jury instruction and ordered a new trial (108 Ga App 581, 133 SE2d 916). In 1967, the accused was again placed on trial for murder under the original indictment. The trial judge, rejecting a double jeopardy claim, included instructions on the offense of murder in his charge to the jury, so that the jury could have rendered a verdict of guilty on that offense. That jury, like the first, found the accused guilty of voluntary manslaughter and fixed the penalty at 10 years' imprisonment. The accused sought direct review of his second conviction in the Supreme Court of Georgia, but that court transferred the case to the Court of Appeals of Georgia (224 Ga 306, 161 SE2d 825). The Court of Appeals affirmed the second conviction, rejecting the double jeopardy argument on the ground that the case of Brantley v State, 132 Ga 573, 64 SE 676, affd 217 US 284, 54 L Ed 768, 30 S Ct 514, was controlling (118 Ga App 207, 163 SE2d 243).

"Regulations governing eligibility for disability benefits under Titles II and XVI of the Social Security Act (42 USCS 401-431, 1381-1383c) establish a ""sequential evaluation"" process. Eligibility is initially determined by a state agency acting under the authority and control of the Secretary of Health and Human Services, and the agency's decisions are reviewable by the Social Security Administration (SSA), which may return a case to the agency for correction. A disappointed claimant is then afforded a three-stage administrative review process, the completion of which results in the exhaustion of the claimant's administrative remedies, and the claimant may then seek judicial review within 60 days of notice of the action taken, as provided in 42 USCS 405(g). A class action was brought in the United States District Court for the Eastern District of New York against the Secretary and the SSA Commissioner by named individuals, seeking relief on behalf of all individuals residing in New York who had applied for or received disability benefits, who had been found to have a severe mental impairment, and who had been denied disability benefits or whose benefits had been terminated, pursuant to an allegedly unpublished and unlawful policy of the Secretary. The plaintiffs claimed that the failure to make the policy known to claimants denied the individual plaintiffs and class members due process of law. Holding that the policy in question was illegal, the District Court also (1) held that the class included claimants who had not exhausted administrative remedies as well as those who had not complied with the 60-day requirement for judicial review, (2) ordered the Secretary to reopen the decisions denying or terminating benefits and to redetermine eligibility, and (3) awarded interim relief (578 F Supp 1109). The United States Court of Appeals for the Second Circuit affirmed, holding that the District Court had jurisdiction over the claims of class members who had failed to exhaust their administrative remedies and the claims of those who failed to seek judicial review within the 60-day period (742 F2d 729, rehearing denied 755 F2d 331).",lexis

"Under the one-person, one-vote principle, jurisdictions must design legislative districts with equal populations. See Wesberry v. Sanders, 376 U. 5. 1, 7-8, Reynolds v. Sims, 377 U. 5. 533, 568. In the context of state and local legislative districting, States may deviate somewhat from perfect population equality to accommodate traditional districting objectives. Where the maximum population deviation between the largest and smalest district is less than 10%, a state or local legislative map presumptively complies with the one-person, onevote rule. Texas, like al other States, uses total-population numbers from the decennial census when drawing legislative districts. After the 2010 census, Texas adopted a State Senate map that has a maximum total-population deviation of 8.04%, safely within the presumptively permissible 10% range. However, measured by a voter-population baseline-eligible voters or registered voters-the map's maximum population deviation exceeds 40%. Appellants, who live in Texas Senate districts with particularly large eligible- and registered-voter populations, ified suit against the Texas Governor and Secretary of State. Basing apportionment on total population, appellants contended, dilutes their votes in relation to voters in other Senate districts, in violation of the one-person, one-vote principle of the Equal Protection Clause. Appellants sought an injunction barring use of the existing Senate map in favor of a map that would equalize the voter population in each district.

"An indictment charged the defendant with engaging in the business of accepting wagers without first filing Internal Revenue Service form 11-C, the special return and registration application required by 4412 of the Internal Revenue Code of 1954, and without first paying the occupational tax imposed by 4411 of the Code. The indictment further charged that when the defendant did file such a form, he knowingly and wilfully understated the number of employees accepting wagers on his behalf--in violation of 18 USC 1001, the general criminal provision punishing the making of fraudulent statements to the government. In the United States District Court for the Western District of Texas, the defendant moved to dismiss the indictment, asserting that the wagering tax laws that required him to file the special return had been held invalid by the United States Supreme Court. The government did not pursue the charges under 4411 and 4412, but argued that the alleged invalidity of the wagering tax laws was ""largely irrelevant"" to the 1001 charge. The District Court dismissed the indictment, reasoning that the defendant could not be prosecuted for his ""failure to answer the wagering form correctly,"" since his Fifth Amendment privilege against self-incrimination would have prevented prosecution for ""failure to answer the form in any respect"" (unreported memorandum; 298 F Supp 1260).",lexis

Defendant could not show prejudice from any failure of counsel to investigate additional mitigating evidence, since the record indicated that defendant would have interrupted and refused to allow his counsel to present any such evidence.

"Michelle Cochran and Axon Enterprise, Inc.‚Äîrespondents in separate enforcement actions initiated in the Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) and the Federal Trade Commission (FTC)‚Äîeach filed suit in federal district court challenging the constitutionality of the agency proceedings against them. When, as in the enforcement actions against Cochran and Axon, a Commission elects to institute administrative proceedings to address statutory violations, it typically delegates the initial adjudication to an Administrative Law Judge (ALJ) with authority to resolve motions, hold a hearing, and then issue a decision. As prescribed by statute, a party objecting to the Commission proceedings makes its claims first within the Commission itself, and then (if needed) in a federal court of appeals. But the parties here sidestepped that review scheme and brought their claims in district court, seeking to enjoin the administrative proceedings. Cochran and Axon asserted that the tenure protections of the agencies‚Äô ALJs render them insufficiently accountable to the President, in violation of separation-of-powers principles. Axon also attacked as unconstitutional the combination of prosecutorial and adjudicatory functions in the FTC.

However, the company's 1974 year-end inventories and accounts receivable were substantially higher than in prior years, and these changes were not fully reflected in the tax return. The company also claimed a deduction of $ 1,103.04 for the expense of transporting two trucks that had been used by the company's shareholders in their individual capacities. The Commissioner of Internal Revenue (1) determined that the company had underpayed its taxes in the amount of $ 154,332.16, (2) determined that the company's failure to use an accrual method of accounting and its deduction of the truck transportation expenses constituted negligence, and (3) assessed a penalty of $ 7,716.61, or 5% of the full alleged underpayment, pursuant to 26 USCS 6653(a)(1), which provides that if any part of an underpayment of certain federal taxes is due to negligence, a penalty of 5% of the underpayment shall be added to the tax. The United States Tax Court (1) held that although the Commissioner did not abuse his discretion in requiring the company to use accrual accounting, the company's use of cash-basis accounting was not negligent, (2) affirmed the finding of negligence with respect to the truck transportation deduction, and (3) recalculated the underpayment as $ 133,248.69 and the negligence penalty as $ 6,943.37.

The Supreme Court, however, has generally recognized a defense of qualified immunity to a Bivens action or claim, where the defendant's alleged acts did not violate a clearly established constitutional right. Allegedly, after a clinical psychologist had resigned from a federal hospital in Washington, D.C., the psychologist began working at a United States Army hospital in Bremerhaven, West Germany, and, in order to satisfy an Army requirement, signed a ""Credential Information Request Form"" asking the Washington hospital to provide information on the psychologist's prior job performance. A former supervisor of the psychologist supposedly replied with a negative letter to the effect that the psychologist had been inept, unethical, and untrustworthy, after which, allegedly, (1) an Army committee denied the psychologist credentials; (2) the psychologist was turned down for a position at another Army hospital; and (3) although the psychologist temporarily worked at the Bremerhaven hospital under provisional credentials, his federal service employment was terminated after his administrative appeal of the denial of full credentials was unsuccessful. The psychologist then filed a suit for damages against the supervisor in the United States District Court for the District of Columbia, and included a Bivens claim that the supervisor, by writing and sending the letter, had caused an infringement of the psychologist's alleged liberty interests under the due process clause of the Federal Constitution's Fifth Amendment, through the supervisor's alleged publication, maliciously and in bad faith, of a defamatory per se statement. The supervisor, in filing a motion to dismiss or in the alternative for summary judgment, asserted the defense of qualified immunity to the Bivens claim. The District Court initially declined to decide the qualified immunity issue and ordered a limited amount of discovery. Upon the supervisor's motion for reconsideration and for a stay of discovery pending disposition of the qualified immunity issue, the District Court denied the motion and expressed the view that the psychologist's factual allegations were sufficient to state violations of a clearly established constitutional right (692 F Supp 1406). On appeal, the United States Court of Appeals for the District of Columbia Circuit, in reversing and remanding with instructions to dismiss the case, expressed the view that (1) to the extent that the Bivens claim was premised on allegations of improper conduct irrespective of subjective intent, a claim was not stated for a violation of any clearly established constitutional right; and (2) assuming that the alleged bad-faith motivation of the supervisor in writing the letter would suffice to make the supervisor's actions a violation of the psychologist's clearly established constitutional rights, the psychologist's allegations were nevertheless insufficient to overcome the supervisor's assertion of qualified immunity, under the Court of Appeals' heightened pleading standard requiring allegations of specific, direct evidence of such illicit intent (282 App DC 392, 895 F2d 797).",lexis

When a dispute developed during construction regarding compensation for extra work, the firm made a formal demand for arbitration of its claim.

"After a jury trial in the Circuit Court of Amherst County, Virginia, an accused was convicted of capital murder. In a separate sentencing hearing, the prosecution sought the death penalty on the basis of the crime's alleged ""vileness,"" an aggravating factor under Virginia law. The accused's counsel, having told the jury that the accused should not be executed in light of mitigating evidence, discussed at length four statutorily defined mitigating factors, involving the accused's (1) lack of prior criminal activity, (2) extreme mental or emotional disturbance at the time of the offense, (3) significantly impaired capacity to appreciate the criminality of his conduct or to conform his conduct to the law's requirements, and (4) youth. The prosecution, while admitting the existence of mitigating evidence and agreeing that the jury had to weigh that evidence against the accused's conduct, argued that the circumstances warranted the death penalty. The prosecution and the accused's counsel agreed that the court should instruct the jury with Virginia's pattern capital sentencing instruction, which stated, among other matters, that (1) before the death penalty could be fixed, the prosecution had to prove beyond a reasonable doubt that the conduct was vile; (2) if the jury found that this condition was met, then the jury could fix the punishment at death or--if the jury believed from all the evidence that the death penalty was not justified--life imprisonment; and (3) if the jury did not find the condition met, then the jury had to impose a life sentence. The accused's counsel requested additional instructions specifically directing the jury to consider each of the four mitigating factors that had been argued and also any other facts in mitigation of the offense, but the court refused to give these instructions. The jury returned with a verdict for the death penalty. The death penalty verdict form stated that the jury had unanimously found the accused's conduct to be vile and had considered the mitigating evidence.

"Petitioner Hosanna-Tabor Evangelical Lutheran Church and School is a member congregation of the Lutheran Church-Missouri Synod. The Synod classifies its school teachers into two categories: ""called"" and ""lay."" ""Called' teachers are regarded as having been called to their vocation by God. To be eligible to be considered ""called,"" a teacher must complete certain academic requirements, including a course of theological study. Once called, a teacher receives the formal title ""Minister of Religion, Commissioned."" ""Lay"" teachers, by contrast, are not required to be trained by the Synod or even to be Lutheran. Although lay and called teachers at Hosanna-Tabor generally performed the same duties, lay teachers were hired only when called teachers were unavailable. After respondent Cheryl Perich completed the required training, Hosanna-Tabor asked her to become a called teacher. Perich accepted the call and was designated a commissioned minister. In addition to teaching secular subjects, Perich taught a religion class, led her students in daily prayer and devotional exercises, and took her students to a weekly school-wide chapel service. Perich led the chapel service herself about twice a year. Perich developed narcolepsy and began the 2004-2005 school year on disability leave. In January 2005, she notified the school principal that she would be able to report to work in February. The principal responded that the school had already contracted with a lay teacher to fill Perich's position for the remainder of the school year. The principal also expressed concern that Perich was not yet ready to return to the classroom. The congregation subsequently offered to pay a portion of Perich's health insurance premiums in exchange for her resignation as a called teacher. Perich refused to resign. In February, Perich presented herself at the school and refused to leave until she received written documentation that she had reported to work. The principal later called Perich and told her that she would likely be fired. Perich responded that she had spoken with an attorney and intended to assert her legal rights. In a subsequent letter, the chairman of the school board advised Perich that the congregation would consider whether to rescind her call at its next meeting. As grounds for termination, the letter cited Perich's ""insubordination and disruptive behavior,"" as well as the damage she had done to her ""working relationship"" with the school by ""threatening to take legal action."" The congregation voted to rescind Perich's call, and Hosanna-Tabor sent her a letter of termination. Perich filed a charge with the Equal Employment Opportunity Commission, claiming that her employment had been terminated in violation of the Americans with Disabilities Act. The EEOC brought suit against Hosanna-Tabor, alleging that Perich had been fired in retaliation for threatening to file an ADA lawsuit. Perich intervened in the litigation. Invoking what is known as the ""ministerial exception,"" Hosanna-Tabor argued that the suit was barred by the First Amendment because the claims concerned the employment relationship between a religious institution and one of its ministers.

"Petitioners brought suit against respondent after a catheter ruptured in the patient's coronary artery during surgery. The catheter was a Class III device that received premarket approval from the Food and Drug Administration (FDA). The Court agreed with the lower courts' determination that 21 U.S.C.S. _ 360k(a) preempted the common-law claims challenging the safety and effectiveness of the catheter. The Court found that the federal government had established ""requirements applicable to"" respondent's catheter within the meaning of _ 360k(a)(1). Premarket approval imposed ""requirements"" under MDA because the FDA required devices that received premarket approval to be made with almost no deviations from the specifications in the approval application. Further, New York's tort duties constituted ""requirements"" under the MDA. Thus, petitioners' negligence and strict liability claims that related to safety and effectiveness were based on New York ""requirements"" with respect to the catheter that were ""different from, or in addition to"" the federal requirements. The Court rejected the contention that the general common-law duties were not requirements maintained ""with respect to devices.""",lexis

"A 17-year old male pleaded guilty to second degree murder and was sentenced to a 10-year prison term in accordance with the Youth Corrections Act (18 USCS 5005 et seq.), under which he was to be segregated from adult prisoners and receive rehabilitative treatment. While in prison, the defendant was found guilty of assaulting a federal officer with a dangerous weapon, whereupon the defendant was given an additional sentence to run consecutively with his term under the Act. The sentencing judge further found that the defendant would ""not benefit any further"" under the Act and sentenced him as an adult. Subsequently, the defendant was convicted of a second assault charge and received another consecutive sentence. At this point, the Bureau of Prisons classified the defendant as an adult offender and, although his Youth Corrections Act sentence had not expired, placed the defendant with the adult prison population. The defendant then filed a petition for a writ of a habeas corpus on the grounds that the Bureau had no authority to treat him as an adult offender during the remainder of his Youth Corrections Act sentence, and the writ was granted by the United States District Court for the Southern District of Illinois.

The pump station emptied water from a canal into a water conservation area (WCA). Respondents argued that the District could not operate the pump station without a point source discharge permit under the National Pollutant Discharge Elimination System because the pump station moved phosphorous-laden water from the canal into the WCA. Regarding the question of whether the operation of the pump station, which did not add pollutants to the water, could constitute the ""discharge of a pollutant"" within the meaning of the Clean Water Act, the Court determined that the definition of ""discharge of a pollutant"" contained in 33 U.S.C.S. _ 1362(12) included within its reach point sources that did not themselves generate pollutants.

"The Education of the Handicapped Act (20 USCS 1401 et seq.) requires participating state and local educational agencies to assure that handicapped children and their parents are guarantied procedural safeguards with respect to the provision of free appropriate public education for such children. These procedures include the right of the parents to participate in the development of an ""individualized education program"" (IEP) for the child and to challenge in administrative and court proceedings a proposed IEP with which they disagree. The father of a handicapped child rejected a town's proposed IEP for the 1979-1980 school year, and sought review by the Massachusetts Department of Education's Bureau of Special Education Appeals (BSEA). In the meantime, the father enrolled the child in a state-approved private school for special education at his own expense. The BSEA thereafter decided that the town's proposed IEP was inappropriate, that the father's choice was more suitable, and ordered the town to pay the private school expenses for the 1979-1980 school year. The town sought review in a Federal District Court, which ultimately overturned the BSEA decision, holding that the appropriate 1979-1980 placement was the town's proposed IEP and that the town was not responsible for the cost at the private school for the 1979-1980 through 1981-1982 school years.

"In four separate proceedings involving unfair labor practice charges filed against employers by unions, the National Labor Relations Board found that the employers had violated 8(a)(5) of the National Labor Relations Act in refusing to recognize the unions, which had sought recognition on the basis of unambiguous authorization cards signed by a majority of the employees, and that the employers had also committed unfair labor practices in violation of 8(a)(1) of the Act in using coercion and threats of reprisals to their employees during the union organization campaigns, and in violation of 8(a)(3) in two of the cases by discharging union adherents. In two of the cases, a representation election had been held and resulted in victory for the employers. In each of the cases the relief ordered by the Board included an order directing the employers to bargain with the unions on the basis of authorization card majorities. In one of the cases (No. 585), the Board ruled against the employer's contention that its statements to the employees to dissuade them from joining the union constituted protected free speech, and the United States Court of Appeals for the First Circuit sustained the Board's findings on appeal and enforced the Board's order in full, including the bargaining order (397 F2d 157).

"Petitioner Andrew Kisela, a police officer in Tucson, Arizona, shot respondent Amy Hughes. Kisela and two other officers had arrived on the scene after hearing a police radio report that a woman was engaging in erratic behavior with a knife. They had been there but a few minutes, perhaps just a minute. When Kisela fired, Hughes was holding a large kitchen knife, had taken steps toward another woman standing nearby, and had refused to drop the knife after at least two commands to do so. The question is whether at the time of the shooting Kisela's actions violated clearly established law.
The record, viewed in the light most favorable to Hughes, shows the following. *1151 In May 2010, somebody in Hughes' neighborhood called 911 to report that a woman was hacking a tree with a kitchen knife. Kisela and another police officer, Alex Garcia, heard about the report over the radio in their patrol car and responded. A few minutes later the person who had called 911 flagged down the officers; gave them a description of the woman with the knife; and told them the woman had been acting erratically. About the same time, a third police officer, Lindsay Kunz, arrived on her bicycle.
Garcia spotted a woman, later identified as Sharon Chadwick, standing next to a car in the driveway of a nearby house. A chain-link fence with a locked gate separated Chadwick from the officers. The officers then saw another woman, Hughes, emerge from the house carrying a large knife at her side. Hughes matched the description of the woman who had been seen hacking a tree. Hughes walked toward Chadwick and stopped no more than six feet from her.
All three officers drew their guns. At least twice they told Hughes to drop the knife. Viewing the record in the light most favorable to Hughes, Chadwick said ‚Äútake it easy‚Äù to both Hughes and the officers. Hughes appeared calm, but she did not acknowledge the officers' presence or drop the knife. The top bar of the chain-link fence blocked Kisela's line of fire, so he dropped to the ground and shot Hughes four times through the fence. Then the officers jumped the fence, handcuffed Hughes, and called paramedics, who transported her to a hospital. There she was treated for non-life-threatening injuries. Less than a minute had transpired from the moment the officers saw Chadwick to the moment Kisela fired shots.
All three of the officers later said that at the time of the shooting they subjectively believed Hughes to be a threat to Chadwick. After the shooting, the officers discovered that Chadwick and Hughes were roommates, that Hughes had a history of mental illness, and that Hughes had been upset with Chadwick over a $20 debt. In an affidavit produced during discovery, Chadwick said that a few minutes before the shooting her boyfriend had told her Hughes was threatening to kill Chadwick's dog, named Bunny. Chadwick ‚Äúcame home to find‚Äù Hughes ‚Äúsomewhat distressed,‚Äù and Hughes was in the house holding Bunny ‚Äúin one hand and a kitchen knife in the other.‚Äù Hughes asked Chadwick if she ‚Äúwanted [her] to use the knife on the dog.‚Äù The officers knew none of this, though. Chadwick went outside to get $20 from her car, which is when the officers first saw her. In her affidavit Chadwick said that she did not feel endangered at any time. Ibid. Based on her experience as Hughes' roommate, Chadwick stated that Hughes ‚Äúoccasionally has episodes in which she acts inappropriately,‚Äù but ‚Äúshe is only seeking attention.‚Äù 2 Record 108.
Hughes sued Kisela under Rev. Stat. ¬ß 1979, 42 U.S.C. ¬ß 1983, alleging that Kisela had used excessive force in violation of the Fourth Amendment. The District Court granted summary judgment to Kisela, but the Court of Appeals for the Ninth Circuit reversed. 862 F.3d 775 (2016).
The Court of Appeals first held that the record, viewed in the light most favorable to Hughes, was sufficient to demonstrate that Kisela violated the Fourth Amendment. See id., at 782. The court next held that the violation was clearly established because, in its view, the constitutional violation was obvious and because of Circuit precedent that the court perceived to be analogous. Id., at 785. Kisela filed a petition for rehearing en banc. Over the dissent of seven judges, the Court of Appeals denied it. Kisela then filed a petition *1152 for certiorari in this Court.

Following her indictment for the second-degree murder of her husband, the defendant moved to suppress three items of evidence discovered by the homicide investigators, including a pistol found inside a chest of drawers in the same room where the victim's body was, a torn up note found in a wastebasket in an adjoining bathroom, and a suicide note found folded up inside an envelope containing a Christmas card on the top of a chest of drawers. The trial court originally denied the defendant's motion to suppress, but subsequently granted the defendant's motion for reconsideration and partially reversed its former decision, holding that the gun and the suicide note were obtained in violation of the Fourth Amendment and therefore must be suppressed.

"A Medicare provider which seeks reimbursement, under the Social Security Act's Title XVIII (Medicare Act) (42 USCS 1395 et seq.) from the Secretary of Health and Human Services for covered health services to Medicare beneficiaries, submits a yearly cost report to a fiscal intermediary--which generally is a private insurance company--that, acting as the Secretary's agent, analyzes the cost report and issues a Notice of Program Reimbursement (NPR) determining the reimbursement amount to which the provider is entitled for the year. A provider that is dissatisfied with an intermediary's final determination of a reimbursement amount can (1) under a Medicare Act provision (42 USCS 1395oo(a)(1)(A)(i)), appeal within 180 days to an administrative review panel, the Provider Reimbursement Review Board, whose decision is subject to review in a Federal District Court, or (2) under 42 CFR 405.1885, request the intermediary, within 3 years, to reopen the reimbursement determination. A home care health services provider that, with respect to the NPR from its intermediary for the year 1989, had not sought Board review within 180 days, asked within 3 years that the intermediary reopen the 1989 reimbursement determination on the asserted ground that new and material evidence demonstrated entitlement to additional reimbursement. After the intermediary denied the request and the Board, asserting that 405.1885 divested it of jurisdiction to review the denial, dismissed the provider's appeal to the Board, the provider brought, in a District Court, an action seeking review of the Board's dismissal and of the intermediary's refusal to reopen. The District Court, in dismissing the provider's complaint in an unpublished opinion, expressed the view that the Board lacked jurisdiction to review the refusal to reopen and that neither the federal-question statute (28 USCS 1331) nor the mandamus statute (28 USCS 1361) gave the District Court jurisdiction to review the intermediary's refusal directly.

"A labor union alleged that a construction company paid substandard wages and fringe benefits. In a shopping mall where the construction company was to build a store, the union distributed handbills urging mall customers not to shop at any of the stores in the mall until the mall's owner promised that all construction at the mall would be done using contractors who paid their employees fair wages and fringe benefits. The handbills made it clear that the union was seeking only a consumer boycott against the mall tenants, not a secondary strike by their employees. The handbilling was peaceful, without picketing or patrolling. The mall owner, after failing to convince the union to alter the language of the handbills or to limit the area of their distribution, filed an unfair labor practice charge with the National Labor Relations Board. The Board's General Counsel issued a complaint against the union alleging a violation of 8(b)(4)(ii)(B) of the National Labor Relations Act (29 USCS 158(b)(4)(ii)(B)), which makes it an unfair labor practice for a labor organization to threaten, coerce, or restrain any person to cease doing business with another person. The Board eventually dismissed the complaint on the ground that the handbilling was protected by a proviso of 8(b)(4) permitting nonpicketing publicity directed at customers of a distributor of goods produced by an employer with whom a union has a labor dispute (252 NLRB 702). The United States Court of Appeals for the Fourth Circuit affirmed (662 F2d 264), but the United States Supreme Court reversed, concluding that the handbilling did not fall within the publicity proviso's scope (77 L Ed 2d 535). On remand, the Board (1) held that the union's handbilling was a form of coercion and was thus proscribed by 8(b)(4)(ii)(B), (2) said there was no need to inquire whether its interpretation of the statute raised serious questions under the Federal Constitution's First Amendment, and (3) issued an order instructing the union to cease and desist from the distribution of handbills (273 NLRB 1431). The Court of Appeals for the Eleventh Circuit, reversing, (1) found serious doubts as to whether 8(b)(4)(ii)(B) could constitutionally ban the union's activity, (2) construed the statute as not prohibiting such consumer publicity, and (3) denied enforcement of the Board's cease-and-desist order (796 F2d 1328).",lexis
"An 1854 federal treaty provided that members of two Indian tribes in Washington had ""the right of taking fish, at all usual and accustomed grounds and stations, ... in common with all citizens of the Territory."" Many years later, after Washington had become a state, its legislature prohibited the use of set nets for catching salmon or steelhead, prohibited the taking of steelhead for commercial purposes, and required that certain types of nets be used for the taking of salmon for commercial purposes. In violation of this legislation, members of the two tribes continued to use set nets to catch salmon and steelhead for commercial purposes, as they had done even before the 1854 treaty. The Washington Department of Game brought suit in the Washington state courts to obtain declaratory and injunctive relief against such violations, and the requested relief was granted. On appeal, the Washington Supreme Court held that although commercial fishing by set nets may have been customary at the time of the treaty, the state could constitutionally regulate the manner of the Indians' fishing, and the case was remanded for further findings as to the reasonableness of the legislation as a method of conservation.

"Officer Wheetley pulled over respondent Harris for a routine traffic stop. Observing Harris's nervousness and an open beer can, Wheetley sought consent to search Harris's truck. When Harris refused, Wheetley executed a sniff test with his trained narcotics dog, Aldo. The dog alerted at the driver's-side door handle, leading Wheetley to conclude that he had probable cause for a search. That search turned up nothing Aldo was trained to detect, but did reveal pseudoephedrine and other ingredients for manufacturing methamphetamine. Harris was arrested and charged with illegal possession of those ingredients. In a subsequent stop while Harris was out on bail, Aldo again alerted on Harris's truck but nothing of interest was found. At a suppression hearing, Wheetley testified about his and Aldo's extensive training in drug detection. Harris's attorney did not contest the quality of that training, focusing instead on Aldo's certification and performance in the field, particularly in the two stops of Harris's truck. The trial court denied the motion to suppress, but the Florida Supreme Court reversed. It held that a wide array of evidence was always necessary to establish probable cause, including fieldperformance records showing how many times the dog has falsely alerted. If an officer like Wheetley failed to keep such records, he could never have probable cause to think the dog a reliable indicator of drugs.",lexis
"From April 1919 to April 1926, a taxpayer paid excise taxes on certain sales and deducted the tax from income before calculation of its income tax. In July 1926, it filed a claim for refund of the excise taxes paid between 1922 and 1926 (refund of those paid earlier being barred by the statute of limitations), brought suit, obtained judgment, and received settlement in 1935. The Commissioner treated the refund as income for 1935 and assessed additional income and excess profits taxes. The taxpayer paid the deficiency so assessed and sued for a refund, contending that the refund of the excise taxes was not income, but that, if it were so considered, the taxpayer should be permitted, as against the additional tax caused by its inclusion, to recoup the amount of the barred excise taxes which it had paid between 1919 and 1922.",lexis

After the owners of land near Devil's Hole began pumping groundwater from certain wells on their land which had the same water source as the pool in Devil's Hole, thereby lowering the water level of the pool, the United States brought an action against the landowners in the United States District Court for the District of Nevada to limit the landowners' pumping in such a way as to prevent the lowering of the pool's water level below that point which was important for the spawning of the fish in the pool. The District Court permanently enjoined pumping that would lower the level of the pool below the point which was crucial for spawning (375 F Supp 456), and the United States Court of Appeals for the Ninth Circuit affirmed (508 F2d 313).",lexis
"When an insurer refused to pay all of a hospital bill, the insured filed suit in an Alabama state court, seeking both payment of the balance and punitive damages for a bad-faith refusal to pay. Eventually, the Alabama Supreme Court affirmed, in a 5-4 decision, a $ 3.5 million jury award for punitive damages on the bad-faith claim (470 So 2d 1060). After the insurer's timely application for rehearing was filed, but before it was acted on, the insurer learned that one of the five justices who joined the per curiam majority opinion had filed two actions against insurers in an Alabama state court alleging bad-faith failure to pay insurance claims, and seeking punitive damages. One suit was a class action as the alleged representative of all other state employees insured under a group plan (including, apparently, all justices of the Alabama Supreme Court). The Alabama Supreme Court unanimously denied the insurer's motions for recusal, stating that each justice had voted individually not to recuse himself, and, by a 5-4 decision, denied the insurer's motion for rehearing. Subsequently, the insurer learned that the litigating justice had authored the per curiam opinion, had put people in touch with his attorney regarding the class action, and had revealed frustration with insurance companies. The Alabama Supreme Court, however, denied the insurer's motion for leave to file a second application for rehearing.

When an officer asked the defendant to explain how he had obtained money found in his possession, the defendant made no response. At his trial in the United States District Court for the District of Columbia, the defendant testified in his own defense and explained his possession of the money. In an effort to impeach this explanation, the prosecutor caused the defendant to admit on cross-examination that he had not offered the exculpatory information to the police at the time of arrest. The District Court instructed the jury to disregard the questioning but refused to declare a mistrial, and the defendant was convicted of robbery.

"At the California trial of an accused who was charged with second-degree murder for allegedly killing his infant daughter, the trial court allowed the introduction of evidence of prior rib and rectal injuries of the daughter to prove ""battered child syndrome,"" which syndrome is said to indicate that a child found with serious, repeated injuries has not suffered those injuries by accidental means. The trial court's jury instructions as to the evidence's use included an instruction that the evidence was received and might be considered only for the limited purpose of determining if the evidence tended to show matters including a clear connection between the other two ""offenses"" and the one of which the accused was charged, so that it might logically be concluded that if the accused committed other offenses, the accused also committed the crime charged. The accused was found guilty. On direct review, the California Court of Appeal, in affirming the accused's conviction, concluded that proof of the daughter's prior injuries to establish battered child syndrome was proper under California law. The California Supreme Court denied review. The accused then filed a habeas corpus petition in the United States District Court for the Northern District of California, which denied relief. On appeal, the United States Court of Appeals for the Ninth Circuit, in reversing and in setting aside the accused's conviction, expressed the view that (1) the prior injury evidence had been erroneously admitted to establish battered child syndrome, because (a) no evidence linked the accused to the prior injuries, and (b) no claim had been made at trial that the daughter had died accidentally; (2) the trial court's instruction on the evidence's use allowed a finding of guilt based simply on a judgment that the accused had committed the prior bad acts; and (3) the evidence's admission, in conjunction with the instruction, rendered the accused's trial arbitrary and fundamentally unfair, in violation of the due process clause of the Federal Constitution's Fourteenth Amendment (902 F2d 749).",lexis

"While on probation following his conviction of criminal charges in New Jersey Superior Court, the defendant was charged with various offenses in Pennsylvania and was convicted and sentenced to prison there. While the defendant was awaiting trial in Pennsylvania, the New Jersey Superior Court, which had been notified of the defendant's violation of his probation, issued a warrant for his arrest, which was lodged as a detainer with the appropriate correction officials in Pennsylvania. Invoking Article III of the Interstate Agreement on Detainers (Agreement), which gives a prisoner incarcerated in one state the right to demand the speedy disposition of any untried indictment, information or complaint that is the basis of a detainer lodged against him by another state, the defendant requested New Jersey officials to make a final disposition of the probation-violation charge.

The plaintiffs alleged, among other matters, that the defendant had diminished the value of a gas-production license that at one time had been held by the Norwegian company. The defendant, in removing the case to the United States District Court for the Southern District of Texas, (1) asserted (a) diversity jurisdiction under 28 USCS 1332, on the theory that the Norwegian company had been fraudulently joined as a plaintiff in order to defeat diversity, (b) federal question jurisdiction under 28 USCS 1331, on the ground that the plaintiffs' claims raised questions of international relations, and (c) jurisdiction under 9 USCS 205, authorizing removal of cases relating to international arbitration agreements; and (2) moved to dismiss the complaint for lack of personal jurisdiction. The plaintiffs moved to remand the case to the state court for lack of federal subject matter jurisdiction. The District Court--without first addressing the question of subject matter jurisdiction--dismissed the case on the ground that the defendant's contacts with Texas were insufficient to support personal jurisdiction, absent evidence that the defendant had engaged in any tortious conduct in Texas or maintained systematic and continuous contacts with Texas. A panel of the United States Court of Appeals for the Fifth Circuit, in vacating and remanding on appeal, (1) concluded that respect for the proper balance of federalism impelled the Court of Appeals to turn first to the issue presented as to subject matter jurisdiction, and (2) examined and rejected each of the defendant's asserted bases of federal subject matter jurisdiction (115 F3d 315, 1997 US App LEXIS 13676, cert den 522 US 967, 139 L Ed 2d 316, 118 S Ct 413).

The DOE conceded that the CWA and RCRA render federal agencies liable for coercive fines--that is, fines imposed to induce compliance with injunctions or other judicial orders designed to modify behavior prospectively--but asserted sovereign immunity from punitive fines--that is, fines imposed to punish past violations of the CWA and RCRA or state laws supplanting them.

"An individual filed a formal petition with the Federal Communications Commission (FCC) requesting it to deny renewal of the television license of a public television station. She advanced two principal grounds for denial, which included that the licensee had failed to discharge its obligation to ascertain the problems, needs, and interests of the deaf and hearing impaired population within the service area and that the licensee had violated, and remained in violation of, 504 of the Rehabilitation Act (29 USCS 794), which provides that no otherwise qualified handicapped individual shall, solely by reason of his handicap, be excluded from participation in, be denied the benefits of, or be subjected to discrimination under any program or activity receiving federal financial assistance. The individual later filed separate formal objections to the renewal of seven commercial television station licenses in the same service area. The Commission, in reviewing all eight proceedings in a consolidated ruling, first found that the licensees' efforts to ascertain the special needs of the community were adequate (69 FCC2d 451). The Commission then held that 504 of the Rehabilitation Act had no application to the seven commercial licensees because they were not alleged to have received any federal financial assistance. The Commission agreed that the public station might be governed by 504, and that a violation of the Act would need to be considered in a license renewal proceeding, but it saw no reason to consider 504 in the absence of an adverse finding by the Department of Health, Education, and Welfare, ""the proper governmental agency to consider such matters."" In a second memorandum opinion and an order denying the individual's petition for reconsideration, the FCC again reviewed the 504 charge and affirmed its earlier holdings (72 FCC2d 273). The Commission also rejected the additional argument that it had a duty to adopt regulations to implement 504. On appeal, the United States Court of Appeals for the District of Columbia Circuit affirmed the portion of the Commission's order that related to the commercial stations but vacated the renewal of the public station's license and remanded for further proceedings (210 App DC 184, 655 F2d 297). The court held that as a recipient of federal financial aid, the public station was under a duty to comply with 504. The court did not hold that the public station had violated 504, or that its efforts to provide programming for the hearing impaired were less satisfactory than the efforts of the commercial licensees; nevertheless, it held that a stricter ""public interest"" standard should be applied to a licensee covered by 504 than to a commercial licensee. Its narrow holding was that the Commission could not find the service of public stations ""to be adequate to justify renewal without at least inquiring specifically into their efforts to meet the programming needs of the hearing impaired.""",lexis
"An Illinois corporation installed a boiler system at the Ohio facility of a Delaware corporation. Six years later, the Delaware corporation, claiming that the boiler did not meet contract specifications and had been improperly installed, brought a diversity action against the Illinois corporation in the United States District Court for the Northern District of Ohio, which action charged the Illinois corporation with breach of contract. The Illinois corporation moved for summary judgment on the ground that the action was barred by Ohio's 4-year statute of limitations. The Delaware corporation argued that the statutory period had not run, pointing to Ohio statutory provisions which (1) tolled the statute of limitations for any period that a person or corporation is not ""present"" in the state and (2) required that a foreign corporation, in order to be ""present"" in Ohio, must appoint an agent for service of process, which appointment operates as a consent to the general jurisdiction of Ohio courts. The Illinois corporation responded (1) that the tolling statute was invalid under the Federal Constitution's commerce clause (Art I, 8, cl 3), or alternatively (2) that the Delaware corporation had been ""present"" in Ohio because it had been continually subject to the ""long arm"" jurisdiction of the Ohio courts.

"Respondent Michael Hewitt filed an action against his employer, petitioner Helix Energy Solutions Group, seeking overtime pay under the Fair Labor Standards Act of 1938, which guarantees overtime pay to covered employees when they work more than 40 hours a week. From 2014 to 2017, Hewitt worked for Helix on an offshore oil rig, typically working 84 hours a week while on the vessel. Helix paid Hewitt on a daily-rate basis, with no overtime compensation. So Hewitt‚Äôs paycheck, issued every two weeks, amounted to his daily rate times the number of days he had worked in the pay period. Under that compensation scheme, Hewitt earned over $200,000 annually. Helix asserts that Hewitt was exempt from the FLSA because he qualified as ‚Äúa bona fide executive.‚Äù 29 U. S. C. ¬ß213(a)(1). Under applicable regulations, an employee is considered a bona fide executive excluded from the FLSA‚Äôs protections if the employee meets three distinct tests: (1) the ‚Äúsalary basis‚Äù test, which requires that an employee receive a predetermined and fixed salary that does not vary with the amount of time worked; (2) the ‚Äúsalary level‚Äù test, which requires that preset salary to exceed a specified amount; and (3) the job ‚Äúduties‚Äù test. See 84 Fed. Reg. 51230. The Secretary of Labor has implemented the bona fide executive standard through two separate and slightly different rules, one ‚Äúgeneral rule‚Äù applying to employees making less than $100,000 in annual compensation, and a different rule addressing ‚Äúhighly compensated employees‚Äù (HCEs) who make at least $100,000 per year. 29 CFR ¬ß¬ß541.100, 541.601(a), (b)(1). The general rule considers employees to be executives when they are ‚Äú[c]ompensated on a salary basis‚Äù (salary-basis test); ‚Äúat a rate of not less than $455 per week‚Äù (salary-level test); and carry out three listed responsibilities managing the enterprise, directing other employees, and exercising power to hire and fire (duties test). ¬ß541.100(a). The HCE rule relaxes only the duties test, while restating the other two. As litigated in this case, whether Hewitt was an executive exempt from the FLSA‚Äôs overtime pay guarantee turns solely on whether Hewitt was paid on a salary basis. The District Court agreed with Helix‚Äôs view that Hewitt was compensated on a salary basis and granted the company summary judgment. The Court of Appeals for the Fifth Circuit reversed, deciding that Hewitt was not paid on a salary basis and therefore could claim the FLSA‚Äôs protections. The court so held based on its examination of the two regulations that give content to the salary-basis test. The majority first concluded that a daily-rate employee (like Hewitt) does not fall within the main salary-basis provision of ¬ß541.602(a), which states: ‚ÄúAn employee will be considered to be paid on a ‚Äòsalary basis‚Äô . . . if the employee regularly receives each pay period on a weekly, or less frequent basis, a predetermined amount constituting all or part of the employee‚Äôs compensation, which amount is not subject to reduction because of variations in the quality or quantity of the work performed. Subject to [certain exceptions], an exempt employee must receive the full salary for any week in which the employee performs any work without regard to the number of days or hours worked.‚Äù Second, the court held that ‚Äúdaily-rate‚Äù workers can qualify as paid on a salary basis only through the ‚Äúspecial rule‚Äù of ¬ß541.604(b), which focuses on workers whose compensation is ‚Äúcomputed on an hourly, a daily or a shift basis.‚Äù Because Hewitt‚Äôs compensation concededly did not satisfy ¬ß604(b)‚Äôs conditions, the court concluded that Hewitt, although highly paid, was not exempt from the FLSA. Reaching the opposite conclusion, a dissenting opinion determined that Hewitt‚Äôs compensation satisfied the salary basis test of ¬ß602(a) and that ¬ß604(b) is not applicable to employees who fall within the HCE rule.",lexis

The United States District Court for the Central District of California denied the motion. The United States Court of Appeals for the Ninth Circuit, affirming, expressed the view that ""federal habeas review"" of the validity of a prior conviction used for federal sentencing enhancement is available only with respect to a claim of failure to appoint counsel for an indigent defendant (195 F3d 501).",lexis

"As the result of law enforcement officials' seizure of firearms from the bedroom of an individual who had previously pleaded guilty in a state court to a felony narcotics offense, the convicted felon was charged with both a receipt and a possession offense under the provision of Title VII of the Omnibus Crime Control and Safe Streets Act (18 USCS Appx 1202(a)(1)) making it a crime for a convicted felon to receive, possess, or transport ""in commerce or affecting commerce ... any firearm."" At the convicted felon's jury trial in the United States District Court for the Eastern District of Virginia, the government offered evidence showing that the seized firearms had traveled in interstate commerce and that the dates of such travel were prior to the time the convicted felon became such, but the government made no attempt to prove that the convicted felon had acquired the firearms after his felony conviction. The District Court, holding that acquisition of firearms after the felony conviction was necessary for a receipt offense under Title VII, granted an acquittal on that part of the indictment charging the receipt offense. Subsequently, the jury found the convicted felon guilty of the possession offense after being instructed that the government could meet its burden of proving the required connection between commerce and possession of a firearm by a convicted felon upon proof that a firearm possessed by the convicted felon had previously traveled in interstate commerce. On appeal, the possession conviction was affirmed by the United States Court of Appeals for the Fourth Circuit (539 F2d 331).",lexis

"A taxpayer who served as the administratrix of her deceased former employer's estate received payments of $ 180,000 in 1976 and $ 133,813 in 1977 from the decedent's brother. The taxpayer paid a gift tax of $ 18,675 on the 1976 transaction and later reimbursed the brother for an additional amount in penalties and interest assessed by the Internal Revenue Service (IRS) with respect to that transaction, but no gift tax return was filed with respect to the 1977 transaction. The IRS, after auditing the taxpayer's 1976 and 1977 income tax returns, determined that the two transactions represented fees for the taxpayer's services as administratrix and should have been reported as income. Accordingly, in 1983, the IRS sent the taxpayer a notice of income tax deficiencies of $ 91,471 for 1976 and $ 70,639 for 1977. The taxpayer, arguing that the transactions were gifts to carry out the decedent's wish that she share in the estate, petitioned the United States Tax Court for a redetermination of the asserted deficiencies. After 2 days of trial, the taxpayer and the IRS settled the case, with the parties agreeing to a stipulated decision that the taxpayer owed income tax deficiencies of $ 10,416 for 1976 and $ 70,639 for 1977. No claim for a credit or recoupment of the gift tax paid by the taxpayer was raised in the Tax Court proceedings. In 1984, immediately after agreeing to the settlement, the taxpayer filed an administrative claim with the IRS for refund of the gift tax, interest, and penalties paid with respect to the 1976 transaction. When the IRS failed to act upon the claim within 6 months, the taxpayer filed suit against the Federal Government in the United States District Court for the Western District of Michigan for a refund of ""overpaid"" gift tax. The District Court, granting the Federal Government's motions to dismiss and for summary judgment, held that (1) the suit was time barred under 26 USCS 6511(a), which provides that if a taxpayer is required to file a return with respect to a tax, the taxpayer must file any claim for refund within 3 years from the time the return was filed or 2 years from the time the tax was paid, whichever period expires later; and (2) jurisdiction over the suit was not authorized under the doctrine of equitable recoupment. The United States Court of Appeals for the Sixth Circuit, reversing on appeal, held that the taxpayer's claim satisfied all of the requirements for equitable recoupment, and that the taxpayer could maintain an otherwise time-barred action for refund of gift tax because the Federal Government itself had made a timely claim of a deficiency in her income tax based upon an inconsistent legal theory (867 F2d 305).",lexis

"An individual who applied for Medicaid benefits from a state Medicaid plan and who was institutionalized in a long-term care facility filed suit in the United States District Court for the Southern District of Iowa, along with her husband, challenging the state's practice of ""deeming"" the income of a spouse as available to the applicant for an unlimited time after an applicant and spouse are no longer living together. The applicant was eligible for, but was not receiving, benefits under the Supplemental Security Income for the Aged, Blind, and Disabled (SSI) program (42 USCS 1381 et seq.) and was thus classified by the program as ""optional categorically needy."" Her husband was not eligible for Medicaid benefits. The state plan was operating under the SSI program, which requires that (1) under 1902(a)(10)(A) of the Social Security Act (42 USCS 1396a(a)(10)(A)), all recipients of SSI benefits be provided Medicaid assistance, (2) under 1902(a)(17)(B) of the Act (42 USCS 1396a(a)(17)(B)), participating states must grant benefits to eligible individuals taking into account only such income and resources as are, as determined by the Secretary of Health and Human Services (HHS) available to an applicant, and (3) under 1902(a)(17)(D) of the Act (42 USCS 1396a(a)(17)(D)), state Medicaid plans must not take into account the financial responsibility of any individual for an applicant under the plan unless the applicant is that individual's spouse. A regulation of the Secretary of Health and Human Resources ( 42 CFR 435.723(d)), promulgated under 1902(a)(17)(B), requires a state to deem the income of an applicant's spouse as ""available"" for one month after the applicant and spouse are no longer living together, when the spouse is not eligible for Medicaid. The District Court certified the suit as a class action, including both SSI recipients as well as the ""optional categorically needy,"" and held that 1902(a)(17) requires the state's procedures to provide a factual determination in each instance of the amount of a spouse's income which is in fact reasonably available for the support of the institutionalized spouse, and that the predecessor to 42 CFR 435.723 was inconsistent with this construction (443 F Supp 1315). In response, the state adopted a procedure for making such factual determinations, and the District Court approved the plan (481 F Supp 914).

"On September 30, 1976, a witness who had testified in June of 1976 before a federal grand jury investigating illicit drug activity at a state penitentiary appeared without counsel in the office of the attorney representing an individual who had been indicted for drug-related offenses on the basis of the witnesses' grand jury testimony, and there, in the presence of the attorney and a notary public, the grand jury witness made an oral statement under oath in which he recanted his grand jury testimony implicating the attorney's client. At an evidentiary hearing held in the United States District Court for the District of Colorado in October of 1976 on the attorney's motion to dismiss the indictment against his client on the ground that it had been based on perjured testimony, the grand jury witness, who was then represented by counsel, adopted the statement he had given in the attorney's office. Thereafter, the grand jury witness was indicted on several counts of making false declarations in violation of Title IV of the Organized Crime Control Act of 1970 (18 USCS 1623), which prohibits false declarations made under oath ""in any proceeding before or ancillary to any court or grand jury of the United States"" (18 USCS 1623(a)), and which provides that the falsity of a declaration may be established to a degree sufficient for conviction by proof that the defendant, while under oath, made irreconcilably contradictory declarations material to the point in question in a proceeding before or ancillary to any court or grand jury (18 USCS 1623(c)). The indictment specifically charged that the witness' testimony before the grand jury was inconsistent with statements made ""on September 30, 1976, while under oath as a witness in a proceeding ancillary to [the prosecution against the individual whom the witness had implicated in his grand jury testimony] ... to the degree that one of said declarations was false."" At trial in the United States District Court for the District of Colorado, the government introduced parts of the witness' grand jury testimony, his sworn statement given at the attorney's office, and in rebuttal, the October statement adopting the previous statement in the attorney's office. Denying the witness' motion for acquittal based upon his contention that the September statement in the attorney's office had not been made in a proceeding ""ancillary"" to a federal court or grand jury as required by Title IV, the District Court submitted the case to the jury on the basis of the inconsistency between the witness' grand jury testimony and his September statement in the attorney's office. On appeal, after the witness had been convicted in the District Court on three of five counts of violating Title IV, the United States Court of Appeals for the Tenth Circuit affirmed, such court, although agreeing with the witness that the interview in the attorney's office was not an ancillary proceeding under Title IV, having determined that the October hearing at which the witness adopted his September statement was a proceeding ancillary to a grand jury investigation, and that the indictment's specification of the September interview in the attorney's office rather than the October evidentiary hearing as the ancillary proceeding constituted a non-prejudicial variance between the indictment and the proof at trial (577 F2d 119).",lexis

"The question in this qualified immunity case is whether two police officers violated clearly established law when they forcibly apprehended a man at the scene of a reported domestic violence incident.
The record, viewed in the light most favorable to the plaintiff, shows the following. In April 2013, Escondido police received a 911 call from Maggie Emmons about a domestic violence incident at her apartment. Emmons lived at the apartment with her husband, her two children, and a roommate, Ametria Douglas. Officer Jake Houchin responded to the scene and eventually helped take a domestic violence report from Emmons about injuries caused by her husband. The officers arrested her husband. He was later released.
A few weeks later, on May 27, 2013, at about 2:30 p.m., Escondido police received a 911 call about another possible domestic disturbance at Emmons' apartment. That 911 call came from Ametria Douglas' mother, Trina Douglas. Trina Douglas was not at the apartment, but she was on the phone with her daughter Ametria, who was at the apartment. Trina heard her daughter Ametria and Maggie Emmons yelling at each other and heard her daughter screaming for help. The call then disconnected, and Trina Douglas called 911.
Officer Houchin again responded, along with Officer Robert Craig. The dispatcher informed the officers that two children could be in the residence and that calls to the apartment had gone unanswered.
Police body-camera video of the officers' actions at the apartment is in the record.
The officers knocked on the door of the apartment. No one answered. But a side window was open, and the officers spoke with Emmons through that window, attempting to convince her to open the door to the apartment so that they could conduct a welfare check. A man in the apartment also told Emmons to back away from the window, but the officers said they *502 could not identify the man. At some point during this exchange, Sergeant Kevin Toth, Officer Joseph Leffingwell, and Officer Huy Quach arrived as backup.
A few minutes later, a man opened the apartment door and came outside. At that point, Officer Craig was standing alone just outside the door. Officer Craig told the man not to close the door, but the man closed the door and tried to brush past Officer Craig. Officer Craig stopped the man, took him quickly to the ground, and handcuffed him. Officer Craig did not hit the man or display any weapon. The video shows that the man was not in any visible or audible pain as a result of the takedown or while on the ground. Within a few minutes, officers helped the man up and arrested him for a misdemeanor offense of resisting and delaying a police officer.
The man turned out to be Maggie Emmons' father, Marty Emmons. Marty Emmons later sued Officer Craig and Sergeant Toth, among others, under Rev. Stat. ¬ß 1979, 42 U.S.C. ¬ß 1983. He raised several claims, including, as relevant here, a claim of excessive force in violation of the Fourth Amendment. The suit sought money damages for which Officer Craig and Sergeant Toth would be personally liable. The District Court held that the officers had probable cause to arrest Marty Emmons for the misdemeanor offense. The Ninth Circuit did not disturb that finding, and there is no claim presently before us that the officers lacked probable cause to arrest Marty Emmons. The only claim before us is that the officers used excessive force in effectuating the arrest.
The District Court rejected the claim of excessive force. 168 F.Supp.3d 1265, 1274 (S.D.Cal.2016). The District Court stated that the ‚Äúvideo shows that the officers acted professionally and respectfully in their encounter‚Äù at the apartment. Id., at 1275.

"Two cases involving the application of the Indiana Racketeer Influenced and Corrupt Organizations (RICO) statute were ultimately consolidated by the United States Supreme Court.

With respect to its RICO charges, the state alleged that the operator had engaged in a pattern of racketeering activity by the operator's distribution of the obscene matter, which, as a violation of the state obscenity statute, was an enumerated predicate offense under the RICO statute.

In the other case (No. 87-470), the state filed a civil action against another operator of an adult bookstore under the RICO statute, alleging that the operator had repeatedly violated the state obscenity statute. The state sought injunctive relief against the operator, including the forfeiture of all of the operator's property used in the course of the operator's obscenity distribution, under a state statute providing civil remedies for racketeering activity. In addition, the state moved for the seizure of the property subject to the requested forfeiture. Finding probable cause that the operator was violating the RICO statute, the trial court issued an ex parte order directing that the property be seized immediately. The bookstore was thereafter padlocked, and its contents were eventually hauled away by law enforcement officials. The operator subsequently filed a motion to vacate the ex parte seizure order on grounds that the RICO and racketeering remedies statutes constituted facially unconstitutional prior restraints in their application to the predicate offense of obscenity. The trial court denied the motion, but certified the issue for interlocutory appeal. On appeal, the Court of Appeals of Indiana, Fourth District, remanded, agreeing with the operator's prior restraint argument (479 NE2d 578). On the state's petition to transfer, the Supreme Court of Indiana vacated and remanded, holding that the seizure order did not constitute a prior restraint or in any other manner violate the Federal Constitution's First Amendment (504 NE2d 559).",lexis
